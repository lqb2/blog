Hey. Welcome to my little piece of the internet. At the beginning of 2016, I told myself I was going to write for 10 minutes every day. It took me a while, but eventually I got there.

### My Writing Philosophy

I write for a few reasons: 

1. I like the idea of [working out loud](http://jarche.com/2014/11/inspiration-for-working-out-loud/). 
1. I want to to get over my anxiety around writing (I'm getting better at this, but it still...)
1. James Baldwin is a hero of mine.
1. The world definitely needs more Black, queer voices. 
1. Because Danielle Coates-Connor told me I should.
1. To put ideas out in an easily shareable way. 
1. To process my thinking in a way that allows me to build on previous thoughts. 

### My Approach

1. I'm constantly collecting ideas to write about. They come from podcasts, conversations, books, and articles mostly. Whenever I come up with a nugget of idea, I save it in a folder on my iPhone Notes app. 
1. In the morning, after meditating, I set my timer for ten minutes (actually, I stopped doing this step in Oct 2016 because it wasn't helpful after having built the habit), pick a post idea from my Notes app, start [Toggl](http://toggl.com), hit play on [my writing playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/1213286621/playlist/0bHjluzadbXKWbzr3a45IO), and write. The ten minutes are more like a guideline at this point... 
1. When I'm done writing, I take 10-20 minutes to find links, type up quotes, format my post in [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and fix typoes.
1. Hit publish.
1. Get ready for the work day.
