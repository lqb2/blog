<p>Welcome to my little piece of the internet. At the beginning of 2016, I told myself I was going to write for 10 minutes every day. It took me a while, but eventually I got there. </p>

<h3>My Writing Philosophy</h3>

<p>I write for a few reasons: </p>

<ol>
<li>I like the idea of <a href="http://jarche.com/2014/11/inspiration-for-working-out-loud/">working out loud</a>. </li>
<li>I want to to get over my anxiety around writing (I&#39;m getting better at this, but it still...)</li>
<li>James Baldwin is a hero of mine.</li>
<li>The world definitely needs more Black, queer voices. </li>
<li>Because Danielle Coates-Connor told me I should.</li>
<li>To put ideas out in an easily shareable way. </li>
<li>To process my thinking in a way that allows me to build on previous thoughts. </li>
</ol>

<h3>My Approach</h3>

<ol>
<li>I&#39;m constantly collecting ideas to write about. They come from podcasts, conversations, books, and articles mostly. Whenever I come up with a nugget of idea, I save it in a folder on my iPhone Notes app. </li>
<li>In the morning, after meditating, I set my timer for ten minutes (actually, I stopped doing this step in Oct 2016 because it wasn&#39;t helpful after having built the habit), pick a post idea from my Notes app, start <a href="http://toggl.com">Toggl</a>, hit play on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/1213286621/playlist/0bHjluzadbXKWbzr3a45IO">my writing playlist</a>, and write. The ten minutes are more like a guideline at this point... </li>
<li>When I&#39;m done writing, I take 10-20 minutes to find links, type up quotes, format my post in <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime</a> and fix typoes.</li>
<li>Hit publish.</li>
<li>Get ready for the work day. </li>
</ol>
