i was at some camp that felt very much like love at work except the buildings were bigger on the inside. 

[scene 1]: there was a giant dance party and lots of people, what felt like hundreds, were standing around in a big circle. it seemed like the dj and live musicians were playing different people's favorite/requested songs. when it was someone's turn to have their song played, they danced extra hard around the room. but i also danced pretty hard to basically every song that got played. 

at one point, there was a song where i ended up talking to someone who i think was a student i had taught. and they were asking me if i had heard the latest about her family. i tried to recall some details but they were all superficial details and she clearly wasn't impressed. i kept trying and eventually just said that i didn't know but she should tell me. she said she would and i said i'd come back to her after i took some medicine to autumn brown.

i then went to find some first aid kit and remembered that adrienne brown had told me to bring a certain type of medicie to autumn. the name seemed very much like a first nation's name [but i can't remember it now]. i finally found it and took it to the room adrienne, autumn, and other person was in. when i got there, adrienne said thanks and they were all sitting around playing this crazy version of uno. 

i was trying to head back to my student but i couldn't pass up the opportunity to play uno with the brown sisters. but i had a very explicit internal conversation about the choice i was making. 

the uno card game was weird and the cards had like conversation bubbles on them so that you had to play cards but there were conversation prompts during the playing. like one card had two  conversation bubbles; one with a blue card silhouette above it and the other with a red card silhouette. i never actually figured out in the game how to use those prompts.
