preface: last night was project night and i did it at jaho. i had one glass (on two small rocks) of nikka coffey grain whiskey around 630p. i ate my 6 oreos and milk in bed around 11.

i was sitting in something like a large church fellowship hall. the room was set up with rows and rows of chairs. i was sitting near the front of the room and the left side of the setup. the setup went farther than i could see to the right of me and behind me and it seem like people were really in all the seats in both directions. 

there was a typical fellowship hall podium and people were coming up to the podium, grabbing the mic, saying things and then sitting down. there seemed to be some pastor there but i don't know who. 

at some point, tig notaro came up with her husband (is that even a thing in real life?) and was holding her baby. someone called the baby a little tiggo and that's all i remember of that encounter. 

and then i remember an uhuru-esque moment where the music was uhuru music and there was some black guy who came up and was dancing and singing. at some point he was making the crowd cheer and stuff and people were making a bunch of jungle noises and it really sounded like the jungle. at some point he got up and was like "singing in the rain" style spinning on what seemed like a tetherball pole in the middle of the front area of the room.

[and then i woke up.]
