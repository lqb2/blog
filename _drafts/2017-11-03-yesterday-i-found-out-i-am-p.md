yesterday i found out that i'm hiv positive. 

i have so many thoughts that it's hard for me to even hold them enough to process them in order. here comes a stream of consciousness. 

* when i was dating d and supporting him through his diagnosis, i wonder if the questions i asked him were too harsh? did i hold him gently enough now that i am asking myself the same questions? did i push too hard? 

* i am positive (damn that word feels different now - which makes that phrase feel different - which makes everything feel dfiferent now - the world feels different now - it has a different texture) that i know who i contracted from and i know when it happened. i wish i had not agreed to bottom that day. it wasn't even that good. ugh. 

* i remember learning that after contracting, people usually get flu-like symptoms for a few days. after d and i would have sex, i remember for days paying high alert to getting sick. and i would rush to get tested. and somehow, over the years, that wore off. and now, when i contracted, i had forgotten. why did i not see the connection? i bottomed and then was sick exactly six days later. ugh.

* i am upset at myself for going off of prep. it would have been so easy and essentially free to stay on it. and now i am positive. forever. 

* forever.

* i don't think  can ever surrogate a child now. i was pretty sure i wanted to adopt anyways, but now i don't have a choice. that loss really hurts. 

* ambroise is visiting and so i am likely not processing this situation as hard as i will later. it's probably gonna hurt. 

* i need to talk to other poz friends. do i need a poz support group? what does it mean to be a poz-activist? is that even something i want? 

* should i tell my parents? (i remember asking dustin that question and these next ones) why should i? why shouldn't i? what might happen if i don't tell them and they find out some other way? what if i tell them and that goes poorly? what if i tell them and that allows them to be advocates? what if they disown me? 

* ambroise posed the critical question to me that i didn't even know i was struggling with: what if being poz means that i can receive less love? 

* on some level, i know that's not real. but my brain is telling me it's real. i know that someone who truly wants to be with me will figure it out with me. but damn does it hurt to think about changing all my hookup app tribes to "poz." 

* it's about identity. i now have an identity that i didn't have before. my core identity is different. and yet, it's not. but it is. i will never not be poz. 

* i haven't cried yet. i wonder if i will dissolve when i do. 

* i am not suicidal but i am sad.
