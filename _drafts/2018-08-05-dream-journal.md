i was working in dusp upstairs in a office that had a bunch of computers in it. danya sherman came in and we started to catch up about life [this is relevant because danya and i have been coordinating lately to set up a catch-up session at the end of august]. i started to tell her how things are going with me but i wanted to say that i was going to leave colab and i didn't want to say it in front of everyone else who was around. so we walked downstairs, down through lobby 10, and somehow when we got there, it was an outdoor area. we talked down on the first level and i told her i was leaving. we had a conversation, but i don't remember it. then we started to walk back and she said she had to go but we'd talk again soon. i walked away from her back into the building and upstairs to the office. 

when i got back sofia campos was sitting at my desk using a computer that wasn't mine but was sitting directly on top of my laptop. i said hey and we cheek kissed and i got my laptop from under the keyboard of her/my computer. i sat down facing her, on the other side of the row desks, and started working... 

at a certain point, i got up and walked over to the next room and there was someone who recognized me. he asked me several questions about how i was and what i was doing and eventually i discovered that he was working at a lab for a dusp professor that i didn't really know. i thought he was cute and he and i walked thru two different open rooms, past several guys i thought were attractive and had known before. but clearly i was interested in the new guy, the unique situation. he sat me down with a colleague of his and it turned out they were both organizers [interesting because yesterday i went to meet ambroise and sophie in her neighborhood, montreuil, which is historically a working class and immigrant neighborhood and we saw the PO, where at least two important unions organize]. they were inviting me to an action but i wasn't interested in going. but i did want to give them a few tips. the other organizer was a woman with big curly hair up top and the sides shaved. she and i had a long back and forth about how she didn't really want any tips or ideas or influence. and i said that was totally fine but i at least wanted one of them to hear my thoughts. she said it was fine if they guy did as long as it didn't change their campaign. 

so he and i walked over to the next room. we looked outside for a minute and there was a beautiful scene looking towards the ocean. i took a photo of it, it was like two small islands, the left one tall with cliffs and the right one shorter but still pretty and a cove of water between them. there was a guy there with his two sons also taking a picture [funny because i've been taking lots of pictures while in tourist mode here in paris]. 

we came back in and i started to tell the guy, his name was jacks [i'm in paris so maybe it was influenced by the name jacques?], my thoughts about cornerstones and the uselessness of most direct action if it's not strategic. i ended up talking much longer than i expected. i thought i had two short points and then they just kept expanding. at certain points it seemed like he was more interested in flirting than in listening to me and i had to ask several times if he was actually hearing what i was saying. it seemed like he was only half listening and it was annoying me. eventually i finished and our conversation was over. were kind of flirty but he shortly walked back to the next room where his organizer friend was. 

i started to look through my black fjall raven backpack [which i've been carrying all around paris]. it seemed like maybe i was unpacking for the day, getting rid of trash and things. jacks came back over and was clearly being very forward and sexual. i was interested and we flirted more a bit. but then he started getting a little strange like before. i said that and he started getting mildly aggressive. i told him i wasn't interested anymore and then he started to get outright verbally aggressive. he said something about if we weren't just across the street from his high school, he wanted to take me out onto the sidewalk and beat me within an inch of my life. we were upstairs, maybe on the fifth floor, and there were stairs outside going down to the ground. i remember vaguely trying to see over if there was a possible escape route that way but there wasn't. he grabbed me by my wrists and i really wished i had my knife or another weapon that could hurt him like a chopstick or something. 

[then, somehow, i recognized that i was dreaming and just woke myself out of it. it was about 6:45a. i tried to go back to sleep by putting on my sleep mask and ear plugs and even meditating but couldn't, so read until 7:45a. then i realized that the reason i couldn't sleep was because it was loud outside so i got up, closed the window, put on the ocean sounds for sleep cycle, and fell asleep until 945a.]

i had another dream that involved a man trying to overpower me, rape me, but i don't remembe rmuch about that one at all. i do remember though that it felt quite lucid. and i slipped in and out of several other dream scenes and it felt like i was mostly controlling them. 

[fully wake up when i heard ambroise moving around]
