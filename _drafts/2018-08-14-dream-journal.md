[scene 1]

i was lying in bed with a partner. the bed was at my old room at 5983 man-o-war trail and it was the bunk bed my brother and i used to sleep in when we shared a room. me and the guy (who i can't quite remember but maybe it was andrew binet) were up top and there was a baby with us. i don't think it was our baby but we were babysitting or something. we were having a really lovely time. 

and then all of a sudden there was another guy in the bed with us and the baby, but we started to have sex. i was mostly holding the baby up in the air and cooing at it while my bf and the other guy went at it next to and around me. at some point, the other guy made my bf cum and i was really jealous but i didn't say anything about it. i just went and lapped up some of the cum. 

at some point soon after, my mom walked into the room without knocking. i was furious! i don't think i yelled at her but we definitely had a spat [this is reminiscent of the moment we had before my paris trip where she trash talked me to my godmother, auntie dedra, about being too independent, even though that's exactly how she raised me lol]. near the end she left and closed the door behind her but before she left i said something like "you do realize you just put another huge barrier in between us, right?"

i went down to the bottom bunk, turned off the nightstand lamp and went back up to sleep with the bf. 

[scene 2]

me and ren were in the day room, the room next door to the first room from scene 1 in the same house. i think we were in a romantic relationship. all of a sudden, we were in the first floor of a really luxurious hotel and there was all this commotion. it seemed like a bunch of athletes, mostly people on foot or bikes were making their way up this really elaborate staircase but in really fantastical ways. 

the hotel was a circular design with the elevators in a column in the middle. and stairs wrapped dna helixes up the inside building, hugging the walls. and the athletes were making their way up the stairs in crazy ways. there was one acrobat who was somersaulting and other things their way up. and there was a biker, i think a really young woman/girl, who was mountain bike hopping her way up. people in the hotel were making a huge deal about it and following them up as fast as possible. 

i told my brother that i really wanted to go. and he said we should shower first. and i said ok, but then got really frustrated that it was taking so long. eventually, i was like... ok how much longer? and he said ten minutes. i said "wow i wish you would have told me that earlier so i could go up." he said "ok, go up, but we're gonna talk about this later." 

i went to elevator to rush up to the to floor where everyone was headed. it turned out, the elevator was a shower and i got wet the whole time i was on the way up [in real life, this was me peeing myself a little bit]. because i was wet and in my boxers by the time i got to the top, when i poked my head out the elevator i looked and saw a room set up like an award ceremony. and eran from dusp was standing at the podium in front of a bunch of little statue prizes. i went back into the elevator and went down.
