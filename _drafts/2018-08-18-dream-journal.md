[scene 1] - farming in the front yard
[scene 2] - end of work day, watching wedding party dance in the backyard
[scene 3] - getting ready in the room and bathtub with andy in the paint shower

[scene 1]

i was doing some sort of house work inside a large house. i walked outside and there was a huge yard and at the edge of the yard was another yard, blocked off by a chainlink fence. on the other side of the fence was an entire food project crew turning the land into a farm. 20 youth, all in green shirts, working the soil, pulling equpiment off a pickup truck and using it. chad valpey was putting metal tomato stake rings into the ground (and of course chatting while doing it and defending his way of putting them into the ground to someone who was questioning him). 

at some point i turned back to focus my attention on the yard i was in and there were two people there, one of them was kathy lebron. kathy was asking about potatoes and how they come up. so i started explaining. and as i got into the explanation, i couldn't tell why i was being so all over the place but i started talking about onions first and then through some roundabout way got to discussing how onions sprouting is sort of like how potatoes sprout. as i was explaining i just felt a lot like i was mansplaining (i think because that's how i was feeling on the phone with kathy). 

eventually i stopped and just went inside

[scene 2] 

when i went inside and walked across the house to the back porch, i saw out the window like 100+ people in fancy wedding clothes standing around in the backyard. it sort of seemed like they were all just standing around but also seemed like people were all focused towards the front of the space where 1-3 people were talking. 

at a certain point i started paying attention in the house again and i realized it was a party connected to my old pace community with kevin o'keefe. and mom o'keefe was, in her classic way, asking me why i wasn't ready and saying that i should hurry up and get dressed or i was gonna miss it. 

[scene 3] 

so i walked over to the room i was sleeping in and it reminded me a lot of rooms from my childhood. big bed in the middle, chest of drawers with a huge mirror on top at the foot of the bed, a wall of windows on the far side of the room, and a large closet on the nearside wall by the door. i went in the closet to see if i had even any nice clothes to wear because i was just there on a visiting trip. more clothes of mine than i expected were in there. 

at first i thought i just had a nice shirt. and then i thought, it'd be great if i had a suit. and then i had a black jacket and pants. and then i thought, i wonder where my trunk club suit is. and then, boom, there it was [i think that means i was lucid. felt very reminiscent of butler's story, martha's book]. after that i felt satisfied to go shower.

i walked over to the shower and it was basically jacuzzi-sized, with dark blue-green walk tiles and the shower head on the rear wall. as i got in the bath, which was full somehow, i noticed there was a TON of paint residue caked onto the wall and tub edges. as i bathed, i realized a n d y short was there and we were bathing together [we were texting right before i fell asleep]. we talked in the tub for a bit and then got out. 

as i started drying off, he took the shower head which was attached to (or actually) a really long hose that had paint containers attached to it. and then he started to spray the shower and the paint came out with the water and got all over the shower. it was beautiful and i started to ask him about it but then i got distracted by his body. as we were both drying off, i noticed that his chest was REALLY nice [which was one of my major turnoffs when we were together]. he said he's been working on it and even doing some experimental treatment program. i asked what the program was and he couldn't really tell me but he distracted me by pulling his towel away and showing me the results. his pecs were furry and amazing and the bottom of his stomach wasn't flabby anymore; it wasn't perfect but it looked a lot like k e l l e n's stomach. like barrel and full but sexy as hell.
