[setting]: in another hotel. [i wonder if writing out the dream from yesterday influenced this dream also being in a hotel].

[scene 1]: i was on grindr and there were three guys i was messaging or thinking about messaging: a black guy and two white guys. one of the white guys i was actually attracted to and the other was a little chubby for me. 

at one point, i was headed into the elevator back up to my room and i passed the black on the guy as he was leaving the elevator. he saw me pull me phone out and said something like "are you about to do a check? it's cool, i'm right here. just come with me now." i was stunned but i realized that it made sense. we'd both seen each other on there and he probably does that same thing when he gets on elevators so it made sense that he could predict i was going to do a similar thing [also sunday while biking to do laundry i realized that i am officially anti-grindr in my stance for the time being. the reason being that grindr makes gays connect with each other *less* in the real world as friends than before. i've had several neighborhood experiences where a guy and i message and then when sex doesn't happen, we don't talk on grindr and he ignores my attempts to make eye contact when walking past each other out in public. i don't like that at all. i want my tools to help us move towards one another, especially as gays in a place, not away]. the elevator started going and i said (honestly) "wow you have pretty eyes and you're very cute but i'm not sure..." and then the doors closed and i went up to my room. 

when i came back down, i somehow ended up on my computer at a small work station sitting next to one of the white guys. and then the other one came up and so i was sandwiched between these two white dudes in public. and i started to feel really guilty about what might happen if the black guy came by. i didn't want him to feel bad and i wasn't there to have sex with the other guys but it just happened. (or did it?)

at some point i got up to go to the bathroom lobby and on the way in i passed a female friend coming out. when i got in, i was a little confused at first because i couldn't tell if i had gone in the bathroom with the right gender. but it was clearly a gender-neutral bathroom. it was strange though because the divider walls were all REALLY low (like mid-thigh height) and i could see into all of them without even trying. 

and then i looked further back into the bathroom, which was carpeted, and there was a little bed, like a bassinette, up on a raised part of the room. a guy standing near the sink in the bathroom part told me it was because the bathroom had been cut into another room but that didn't really make sense to me.

[scene 2]: this scene wasn't actually in the hotel. i don't remember that much about this but i do remember that i had sought out maanav as a spiritual teacher/guide. and he said something to me about seeing a lot of colors. like... 16 colors, each in two shades. and that was important for some reason. 

[scene 3]: i was on a beach trip with lots of people. many folks weren't getting in the water yet, but i was one of the first. it was clearly open ocean and the waves weren't too bad. there was a platform like at the maine house out and i walked/swam out to it. slowly more people started coming out and i was urging people to just get their bodies all the way in the water. 

at some point, i was getting ready to start swimming by myself and i saw a bunch of people lined up from the beach and coming into the water in single file line. katherine was in that line too alongside someone else i knew but i can't remember any more. 

i started to backfloat and just swim around for fun, looking up at the sky and enjoying being by myself. eventually, i started moving towards land. i was surprised that i could still backfloat so close to the shore, but i kept doing it anyways. 

then, it started to storm. the ocean turned very brown and i made my way to the beach. then it started to lightning very intensely. we could see the storm far off, striking buildings in a big city way down the beachfront and we all rushed to get our stuff together. i was trying to put all the stuff i'd brought into my fjall raven backpack, but i kept thinking i was missing things. but then i'd find the things. one thing i kept missing though was a square of material, the size of my bluetooth mac mouse, but made of stuff like the thick plastic cutting boards me and luke have. eventually everyone started hurrying as the lightning got closer and i helped others. i do think i ended up finding that square and felt really relieved.

[other scene]: we were in the stott's house and all i remember was them having set up a store and there were a bunch of whistles on colored lanyards hanging on the front and back of a set of pocket doors. and the fridge had a bunch of orange ones that clearly were for the family and not for sale.

[wake up]

note: i actually don't remember if all this came in this order. i also couldn't recall much when i was lying down after waking trying to take myself back into dream land. all i could remember from that was the part about maanav. i'm clearly being influenced by that little bit of reading i did about lucid dreaming. anyway, when  i got up and got on grindr to see if my new sub neighbor had messaged me like i told him to, the hotel dream started to come back. and then as i started typing, the beach and stott house dreams came back.
