i was walking behind fresh market in tallahassee on a path that was wide enough to be a bikepath (unpainted). turned out i was with a guy who was a strange blend nick reed and derek reed. or maybe it was one of them i can't remember which one it was anymore... either way, he was shorter than me so i think it was derek's body. but the voice and energy felt like nick's. 

as we were walking and talking, i basically expressed my interest in him and he was shocked but then very interested back. we talked a little bit about the old days and how much time we'd lost while in the same place and not being together. and then we walked up to a big street, the one that you took if you turned right from thomasville road went by the lay-z-body building. the street was packed full of a long line of cars and clearly something at a school was going on. 

somehow we walked over to chiles high school and walked into a classroom where something registration-like was happening. that's what was causing the car backup. we walked over to see who was still that we'd remember and rima kelley stood up, came over, and gave us hugs. 

[wake up]

after i woke up, i spent a few minutes in bed trying to think through who would still be at chiles that i even remember. i also wondered (and still do) about derek and his sexuality. he's always been so quiet about it. that's such a giveaway in my book.
