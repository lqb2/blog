i don't remember the full arc of the dream even though i laid in bed and tried. what i remember is the setting of the dream: it was some camp/retreat center-type compound up in the hills somewhere. felt like it could have been something like knoll farm but with more constructed buildings and fewer yurts. i remember basically three or four scenes:

[scene 1]: we were in the indoor amphitheatre and the hosts (i think there were two) had just finished a short chant from the stage where they basically rapped all the different names of the miliary branches together. and then there were a bunchof military personnel standing on the stage in the line and we were giving them a standing ovation. i was the only person still seated and i was just looking around, at the stage, back up at higher up rows in the  theatre and wondering what would happen if we stopped honoring the military. 

[scene 2]: i was heading to go shower and was debating between the women's shower and the men's shower and i went for the women's shower room because there were fewer people in it. the shower rooms were like giant locker rooms where you stood in lines facing the mirrors but the shower/bathroom stalls themselves were on the wall to the right. 

then i remember being in a stall and getting up on a toilet that was like 3 or 4 feet high in the air and looking down at other people's feet in the neighboring stalls.

[scene 3]: we were coming outside after something and i was walking over to a table with challie schafer. the light was dappled as the sun was setting but i wanted to sit in the sun so i asked if we could sit at a different table than the one we almost settled at. we moved so i could be in the sun [i do this actual thing, trying to maximize my time in the sun, often and i did it a lot in maine] and started talking. i wanted to sit at the end of the picnic table,though, where theere was no bench so i kept saying to her "i'm still listening" while i walked over to the tent that had lots of other tables with movable seats. they were these little wooden boxes with a mostly flat cushion on one side. i grabbed three and then made a little pyramid to sit on [i wonder if that shape, a triangle made of three cubes will be important to me in real life...]. the only thing i remember talking about was our right hand, ring finger rings. i think they were both mit rings and we were both talking about how happy we were that we had gotten them and gotten them re-done (though now i can't really remember what that meant]. 

[scene 4]: i was out in a lake [the lake seemed similar to the lake at the waterboro house in maine at roy and robin's] with adrienne maree brown, autumn brown, and one other person. we were just swimming around and then adrienne and autumn started to strip down to skinny dip. then i took off my trunks. i don't remember what the other person was doing. then i said, "i have a small confession to make [note: interesting that i was making a confession while in water, which has ritually be useful for cleansing]. i can't really float." and then adrienne said to try it and i did and just sank. i swam back and she said something like "i think you can, you just need to tap more into your ancestral memory of how." and then i tried it and i actually could do it a little bit!

then i remember going to shore and talking to some people who were standing up on the bank. i asked someone what time it was because i didn't want to miss dinner. somehow my shorts had gotten back on and the brown sisters and the other person were over by the dock we'd come into the water on. 

i had gotten out of the water and was coming down the steep hill back to the shore and trying to step, barefoot, onto some rocks below while stabilizing myself on a small, young tree. one rock i stepped on was really loose but i made my way down. 

as i got back over to the dock, there was a young man in some sort of outdoor kitchen making food for himself before the main camp/retreat dinner at an island counter facing the water. i was sitting at a similar thing, but it was more like a short version of long-bar and i was at an angle facing into the kitchen and towards him. i started to make a bowl of cereal but i knew dinner was soon so i didn't want to waste the food. but when i looked down, i already had a bowl of cereal and a bag of what seemed to be raisin bran except the cereal pieces were shaped like golden grams. there were definitely raisins on the box decoration, though. and the milk was in the bag, not in the bowl. and then i kept trying to figure out how the milk had gotten inthe bag and how icould get the cereal out so it wouldn't be soggy. i was tinking about having it later, but i wanted to ask around to see who the cereal belonged to. i kept having a sense that it belong to the guy who was cooking at the island in the kitchen but i couldn't bring myself to ask him. he kept glancing over but also didn't say anything. 

[wake up]

note: including that i'm looking for fall housing in next newsletter
