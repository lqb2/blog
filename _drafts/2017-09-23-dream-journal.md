preface: i went to bed last night with two glasses of moscato, 1/2 aslice of chocolate cake, and two small scoops of sweet cream ice cream on my stomach. had a crazy dream (which often happens when i go to sleep immediately after having lots of sugary dessert). i woke up and remembered it was two parts, but even though it's only like four minutes after i've woken up, i'm already forgetting the first part. writing the 2nd part now while i still can. it was nuts. 

[begin dream]

i was really tired but i had just walked onto a plane. i had a first class ticket (seat 1b) so i sat down right as i walked on the plane and fell asleep. i missed all the announcements and takeoff and woke up as we were landing. when i looked at the window, it was clear that we weren't where i thought we were going. i was supposed to be headed to nyc or dc or something for a funder meeting for work. i asked the guy next to me where we were: he said we were in ashe, netherlands. i was shocked. 

next thing i know, i'm in a taxi headed to a hotel trying to text people back in the u.s. that i'm in the wrong country. but, of course, i don't have cell phone service. the car is driving and i'm sitting, watching all sorts of colorful buildings slide by. the car pulls into a parking lot that is surrounding by buildings and it feels very touristy. i see a restaurant that looks delicious that i want to try later and one of those giant souvenir stores that sells everything, has giant neon-paint colored letters in the windows and has terrible florescent lighting. 

and then i woke up. 

fucking weird.
