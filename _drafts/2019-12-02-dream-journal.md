[scene 1]

i was standing alone watching two friends walk off to the right together, seemingly in a mall corridor [last week, while i was home, i thought about the tallahassee and governor's square mall for the first time in years]. i'm not sure where i was standing but they were at least 25-50 feet away from me and i think i was standing outside or in the woods... one of the people had jeff chelf's body and definitely his head and hair, but the voice wasn't jeff's. the other person i can't remember what they looked like and i don't think they spoke. jeff was telling the person how he didn't really have any hobbies and i just watched them keep walking until they walked out of my sight.

[scene 1.5]

i don't think there was a really scene change; i think i just shifted my attention fully to the forest i was in. 

i looked down and there was a small tree stump that was clearly for whittling [at man-o-war park, which i visited on saturday, i sat on a chunk of a felled tree and there were several rounds of it around]. someone else was there who i was supposed to be teaching to whittle but i can't remember who it was. we sat down and i started showing them how to do it. the wood was SUPER soft and i was showing him (was it a he?) how to strip the bark. he wasn't good at first and i had to jump in a few times to show him how to do it. he kept wanting to wet the blade [my IG friend, atlasandwebster, who i hooked up with him and his bf once, was telling me how to do a sunflower score on sourdough and mentioned to keep wetting the scoring blade] but that's not needed for whittling. the student started to get it and then...
