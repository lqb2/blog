i was sitting in some sort of observatory tower in a giant open control room. sort of like the big old nasa control rooms. there were screens to look at different parts of the world and also down to the ground i think. 
i had three successive meetings with three different women. they each came up to chairs in front of the control panel where i was sitting. they sat next to me.

the first came and was wanting to tell me about some research she was doing. she was studying earth and atmospheric sciences it seemed and she was showing me her reasearch areas on one of the big screens. she was zooming in to this one area of planet (couldn't tell if it was earth or mars or somewhere else) and just trying to tell me how interesting it was. i asked her if i could do anything for her and i don't remember her response. 

the next person was a student from dusp. as i talked to her, i realized it was carrie watkins. i also realized i should connect her to then researcher i had just met. i tried to but carrie resisted. even though the researcher was going to be student at dusp in the fall, carrie said she was trying not to be annoying and up in people's business. i said she should really follow up on the connection and i would, too.

the third person came up during my session with carrie. i think it was dayna. she came up and said something to the effect of needing recommendations about what to bring on a trip given the weather there. for some reason, where she was going was also related to the region that that first person, the researcher, was going so i went back there on the map and zoomed in to find the weather. i told the women the weather and she left to pack her bag. 

[wake up]

as i was waking up, i was still trying to remember back to the dream and i finally latched into the idea that i had to email carrie watkins back. that's what triggered my remembering the rest of the dream. that body sensation connected to the memory of the dream connected me back to the whole dream. pretty cool. i'm learning more about to tap back into the dreams: find the sensation...
