## the program 

### limiting belief

the limiting belief i worked through was "i don't have enough money." my pose was me stepping forward, thrusting my hands out in front of me with my palms up and yelling "i have **exactly** enough money." the shift showed up before even leaving cortes (i thought i didn't have money to test my trojan mouse, but i realized i could use the leftover money from the trip) and has shown up several times since getting back from cortes. havin the somatic body response actually is annoyingly helpful. 

### healing and victim story 

the evening we did our victim stories i trioed up with kendra and austin. each of them really worked through something and got to a place to fully exposed brokenness. i talked about my issues of feeling powerless in my family life and while i got sad, i didn't really break down in tears. which i wanted but either (a) my gatekeepers were working super hard or (b) i actually picked a victim story that wasn't that deep (i think i misunderstood the instructions). 

anyway, over the course of the week, it became clear that my project and vision had a lot to do with men's healing work. and so, on the second to last day, i started making moves towards opening myself up to my own healing process. kendra told me during the feedback line that she wanted me to know that she was available for me to open up to and to help me process. on the last day, i told kendra and austin that i'd had a vision of going through the unburdening process with them. they both said they were down whenever. and then, just a few hours later when we had some free time between the end of the workshop and getting on the water taxi back to campbell river, i said to the two of them (crismaldi was also around) that there are two songs i wanted to listen to with them and unburden. i started waffling about how to do it (in the big main room, outside, inside...) and kendra just sat me right down and said: "you know what you need. just tell us." and that's all it took. in that moment, i felt like i fully stepped into the role of leading my own healing. i was super clear that i wanted to go back to their room, listen to two songs (two by sleeping at last and over the rainbow by todrick hall), and have them hold me. i really liked that line g dropped earlier during the week: "right now is a special time; because you are held more than you are in your usual life (you're being fed, your housing is all set, i'm leading the workshop) you can go farther, deeper than you do in your normal life." in normal life, you can't extend yourself past safety because you need to be put together enough to take care of yourself. but in spaces like e.l., it's possible to let go a little more because there's a real safety net. 

so i got my towel, speaker, walking stick, swim trunks (i was hoping to go on a walk and last swim with jess and folks), and walked over to their room. they were there, sitting like angels, waiting on me. i laid down, put on the two songs, and played them. they both laid their hands on me (kendra sitting to my right and holding me around my sides, austin sitting above my head and putting her hands on my temples, shoulders, upper arms; both of them rubbing and holding) as i got more and more out of control (free?). i really got to the depths of those two issues and now i feel ready to move them forward. 

* two - my enneagram number often puts me in a place of sacrificing myself for the well-being of others without being well myself. i need to shift that pattern. 
* over the rainbow - i need to deal with the fact that my dad doesn't accept queerness and i think he might also actually be closeted.

i was debating which water to go to and austin suggested that i just go to the water that was closer to to the cabins, out where i went to meditate each morning. 

as i went down, there were a bunch of people there who still had to get on the first water taxi back to campbell so they all left. and the only people that were left were jax and eroc, already in the water. i walked up thinking "this is just perfect" and asked eroc to dunk me. he immediately snapped into healer mode. he asked me what the water was going to do, i said cleanse me and make me strong to do the work i need to. he had me squat til the water was up to my belly. he dunked me and then surprised me by saying i had to do it two more times. i was totally not expecting that and my body had a CRAZY reaction. i was yelling and shivering and just totalled unprepared. when i came out from dunk three i felt energy moving through me like i haven't in a while. it was intense and so good. and it was so good that jax was there to witness. 

everything was just perfect.

### feedback line 

during the feedback line, the feedback words i got most often were:
* beauty (10+ times)
* grace
* wisdom
* humility (from g while on the couch during my break because we had an odd number of people)
* presence
* "like a tree: broad, strong, tall, deep, rooted"

the things i wrote down as growth egdes are: 
* i should share more of my introvert ways/methods/techniques
* build more places of interconnection with people (because i manage my time so tightly, i run the risk of not connecting with people)
* get another project on the books with maureen
* things i need to step into more: art, play, acting, singing my art more: play, acting

i want to add that it was so intense to watch maureen experience the feedback line. it is a really intense experience in general to be given direct feedback about yourself and then begin to hear resonance across multiple people. but for her, she said she just kept hearing the same thing over and over again. and at one point (i think one of her transformative moments during the week if not her only one) during the line she burst into tears and had to lie down on the ground and weep. it felt so intense to just be in the room with her. eventually she got back up and rejoined the line but started weeping again when i gave her my feedback. i'm guessing it was the same thing she kept hearing (which would make sense because she's clearly living into her true self). i feel lucky to be in community with her given the work she's doing on herself and therefore, in transformation of the world. 

### my three God moments

over a period of about 24 hours, i had three moments of remembering my divinity.

1. jess and i were the two people in jorge's peer coaching session. during the second rapidfire mouse workshop, jess and i were sitting next to each other on the couch (her shoulder was hurting and so she was using a heating pad to diminish the pain–because what else could have happened?) and jorge was sitting in a chair opposite us. and for some reason, jess and i were just sitting so close and we were holding hands on her knee and it just felt so... God. the two of us were loving, unbelievably excited parents (God) watching our child (also God) come back into himself. he was so excited and eager to hear from us and we gave our thoughts so lovingly. it just seemed like... holy shit this is what it is. this is what it feels like. i don't want to ever forget that moment.
2. then, in one of the sessions, g talked about the two different yogic paths to divinity. one path, the 'not this, not that' path, requires unceasing, relentless, repeated acknowledgement that nothing is as it seems. everything is as the seeing sees it. which is to say... that which perceives is God; nothing else is God. the other path is to take everything as God and, eventually, by looking at everything as God you begin to see and then believe that everything *is* God.  

this felt crazy to me to hear because the night before i had just read a short story called 'the book of martha' which is the last story in bloodchild (a series of short stories by octavia butler). and in that story, the main character comes to realize that, not only is She God, but that She fiddled with humanity to try and help the species (She chose to make people's dreams more powerful) and then She made herself forget that She had actually done that. it was an embodiment of the 'self-concealment' and revelation moment. 


3. jen and i had scheduled a lunch together after my freakout moment during "the work" session that maureen led. and as i walked up to her, sitting so beautifully under one of the apple trees, next to the fig tree in the middle of the small orchard, i just had this overwhelming sensation of all the beauty that there is and ever has been and ever will be right there, right then. i felt like i was walking in the garden of eden (which maybe is just earth when it's healthy?) i think that image is burned into my retinas and mind. for whatever reason, she and i can see God in each other so easily.

one other moment i want to remember was manifesting eroc while walking towards the beach from the woods and talking with jax. we were just walking and talking and i started to mention eroc being in my coaching group and some of the things he brought **and then i looked up and he was just sitting on a rock in front of us, journaling.** maybe it was just a coincidence but it also is what kept happening in the book of martha story... she'd say something like "i thougt there'd be a rider here in heaven" and then a river would appear. manifesting.

### the work and the universe opening up in front of me

maureen led a session on "the work" by byron katie and kendra was in the hot seat. the work activity is just a simple worksheet that asks you to shit talk about someone else and then interrogate all the statements you made about that person and make them be about yourself. it's super powerful stuff. 

the story for me, though, is that while kendra was in the seat, doing the work in front of everyone, after about question 3 i sort of checked out. i was feeling so much that i couldn't really handle the ongoing interrogation. and by the time maureen got to question 5 i had to literally interrupt the room and let everyone know that it was too much. as she got ready to start the next question, everyone gasped every time but it kept getting more and more intense. i also saw other people's faces, including g's, when she started on question 5 and i just couldn't take it. i said i needed a break to process my own stuff and that if she was gonna keep going, i had to leave. maureen wanted to keep going, so i left and went and sat outside in the sun. and what i was realizing was that i felt like the whole universe opened up in front of me. given that just these six statements totally flipped kendra's world (and mine) upside down and inside out, i started to think... how many of **my** stories about the world could this happen with? every person that i've ever felt ill towards... i could not and could use that as opportunity to work on myself. it was just so much that i was overwhelmed. i went to sit in the sun and just breathe and be in my body. 

thankfully, jen came out to tend to me and it was so lovely. again, it's just amazing to see God walking towards you. she laid with me and just held space for me to be in my body. i shared a few thoughts with her to debrief but then we started talking about seeing God in each other and that we should do lunch that day and talk about our projects because they are related. 

### my mouse - the cre-action process

* **name your dream**: the big idea is that men, on their own, can learn from the future about how to live (in the present) in non-patriarchal ways. by time-traveling on 1-day, weekend, and maybe even longer excursions to off-the-grid places/land/retreat centers, men can practice non-patriarchal ways of being and then bring those lessons back to their lives.
* **trojan mouse**: 
    - a: a half-day meeting where the men involved eat, hang, and then articulate to themselves what their 3 levels of mentorship look like: who is holding them (elders), who are they practicing and learning with (peers), and who are they holding (mentees). my assumption is that these structures won't be built out and that the meeting will end with people committing to working towards filling out these circles. success will look like people being energized to start building out their circles. 
    - b: a website splashlanding page that allows people to sign up with interest for the big vision: men learning, through practice, from the future, on weekend retreats, about how to live in a post-patriarchy world. (note: i know that racism and patriarchy interlock. that will be in the strategy but not in the messaging). 
* **act quickly**: 
    - today's date: june 18
    - launch date: aug 31 at the latest
    - review date sept 15
* **with the resources at hand**
    - my plan was to use the remaining money in my e.l. budget to buy food for the 3-4h meeting but it turns out that i actually had spent that money on alcohol but i didn't get the venmo request from austin til later. 
    - now my plan is to just save $150 and use it for food.
    - i'm not sure where to host the meeting but it would be nice if i could get the dojo
* **within acceptable loss**. consider your resources and define acceptable loss. what is the risk that you can take? make it safe enough for your mouse to *fail*
    - my money for food can be lost
    - i am risking the time and investment of people i invite if the session isn't good or doesn't get anyone where they want to be or catalyze them to take future action
    - i am risking my personal brand as i step into this work in boston as (mostly) an outsider
* **bringing others along**. who are your stakeholders? who are your supporters? who are the people who will be kept informed about what you are trying out and how you define "success" or "failure." this is like your personal board of directors
    - peer-advisors: eroc, seth, gibrán, david leonard (added on 6 july), jay dev
    - other leaders in the field: brandon sloan, abraham
    - people who i think need this: camilo, dan schenk, reggie hicks, reed jorden
    - women & gnc folks: jax, cameron, miriam, annemarie, diana, katherine
* **iterating**. once you know whether your mouse "succeeded" or "failed" you come back to this place and you start again. what did you learn? what will your next trojan mouse look like?
    - n/a for now
* **ideas**
    - from katherine evering-rowe
        + find jp healing and trauma center
        + see if i can find person who would be down to consult or advise or partnership
        + maybe there are people who would be involved inwith this but isn't clinical or medical therapy
        + book: trauma-sensitive mindfulness
        + group: liberation health (maybe)

### meditation and meeting (summoning?) an otter

every morning i got up and went down to the water to meditate for an hour. of three mornings i was on the rocks down at the beach that was easy to get to. i would go out pretty far to the right and marisol got a photo of me there actually. i saw lots of animals including a seal, canadian geese, and what seemed like several small whales surfacing, breathing thru their blowholes, and rolling over, splashing the water as they went. 

[insert photo]

on at least two of those days, i saw and/or heard jess doing her morning yoga routine and chanting. she was usually up on the cliff that was to the left of the where everyone would sit on the beach and we gave each other our space. but i knew that something was drawing me to go sit up on that cliff one time. 

the 4th day i went to beach we came in to and though i had a good sit out there, it took forever to get there because the rocks were pretty awful. 

the last morning, i went down and just went up the cliff. later i saw jess looking out from the dorm building she was in and so i didn't feel bad about taking her spot. as i sat, i noticed an animal making its way in and around the inlet. eventually, it swam under me and i got a little video of it. 

[instagram video of me looking down at the sea otter]() 

it kept making its way around the beach, slowing down sometimes, goin up to the rocks sometimes. eventually, it swam back to the island in the middle of the water and i lost track of it. 

then later, close to the end of my session, it just appeared! it had come all the way up the cliff i was sitting on (which had to be at least 40 feet up from the water) and appeared to be scrounging for food. at first, it didn't even notice me. and as it kept coming, it noticed me and just started at me for some seconds. i stared right back, our eyes linked and locked. it was an electric couple of seconds. and then, it just turned around and started walking away pretty casually. i got a little video of that part, too. it wasn't running in fear (for some reason) and just seemed happy enough to go on it's way. 

i'm really glad i went up on that cliff that final morning. maybe the otter appearance was a precursor, an omen, to the time i was going to spend in the water that afternoon. 

### tarot

this week there were several tarot firsts for me. i asked jax to do my first tarot reading ever. after that, i also came down to the meeting room/kitchen every morning and pulled a card for myself (this includes the first tarot card i've ever pulled, for myself or anyone else). this is also what lead to me feeling comfortable enough to call jax and ask for a reading before my conversation with my boss to give my notice. 

i also need to say that i jax let their hair down when we got to channel rock and i definitely noticed. and, i don't know, this is probably stereotypical in some shitty way, but for some reason, with their hair down, jax looked exactly like someone who i would imagine who would do my first tarot reading. they just looked... witchy, you know? i'm not sure where the image of an appropriately witchy person came from in my mind (lol hocus pocus maybe), but it all felt right in the moment with me sitting in front of them with the cards between us. 

here's all the cards and some of the descriptions: 

june 16 - jax, intention: can't remember
june 17 - me, intention: can't remember, two of branches
june 18 - me, the hermit (intention was about how to relate to my vision/project; how would it support/integrate (or not) with my life?)
june 19 - me, intention: can't remember, student of knives (reverse)
june 20 - me, intention: can't remember, five of knives (reverse)
june 22 - jax, intention: how to hold the conversation with dayna as i give her my notice. 
* main card: the devil. 
* next three cards (for detail/elaboration on the main card): nine of vessels (reverse), the precipice (reverse), ace of stones (reverse). 
* the card that fell out of the deck while jax was shuffling and i was sharing my intentions: student of branches.

## what's happened since... 

## june 24 - reggie

reggie called me yesterday. i called back. he said he wrecked the car (again) last night. that the drinking is too much. that he's reaching out right now to everyone that he can. he knows he's hanging around the wrong crowd. he wants to break free of his childhood, his younger years, his gang days, but he can't. 

i think i manifested my own test of my vision. well, damn. i'm tired, but here we go. 

## june 22 - giving my notice at colab

i was committed to giving my notice (that decision became abundantly clear while on cortes). thankfully, i had already set up a two hour meeting with dayna to discuss a bunch of other things. 

for some reason, i had the urge to connect with jax and have a card pulled before the meeting. i had lots of other things to do during that window of time, but i called jax anyways and they did **the** most amazing card reading for me. but, as they say, the tarot just gives you what you already have. and what it gave me, was so dead-on it was laughable. it's nice to know you're in alignment. 

while shuffling the deck, one card fell out of the deck and jax put it to the side. i was explaining to jax the situation at work and also the weirdness that had happened with dustin on the 21st. jax said they had pulled the cards and was ready when i was. the cards were fucking perfect (as they always are). the first card was the devil, right-side up, and the description for that card begins
```Recognize how you're bound, and how you can get free.
```

the other three cards in the 4-card spread were reverse (which in the slow holler deck means something, maybe energy, is blocked). and the card that popped out early was the student of knives. and knife and branch cards had been in my readings all week. the cards were just perfect and we finished right in time for me to walk over to my boss. 

we walked and talked around cambridge, headed towards gather here so i could buy some yarn for a scarf<!-- for eroc -->, and generally had a really good time. we had a very wandering conversation about the organizational climate, about planning a reflection in the bronx, and we got to a conversation about me and dayna's primary disagreement: i think personal change and healing processes _are_ the pathway to liberation and she thinks the path to liberation involves putting the self aside to focus on systems and structures, knowing that there will be time and space to work on the individual along the way. as we got super clear about our intense disagreement there, it affirmed the decision i had made to leave colab. i need to be under the leadership of someone whose theory of change is the same as mine. or i need to be working for myself and have the majority of the agency. i told her about the healing work for men using sci-fi and she said it resonated but also that she was sad. she was also happy that i have such a clear vision for what's next. 

### june 21 - $3,000

i've been saving to pay off my credit card all at once ($3000). dustin and i were texting and, turns out, he needed exactly $3000 to pay off all the back rent he had put on his credit card from when he moved up to boston so we could try living together. i have exactly enough money, right? ugh lol. guess there's no time like the present to practice generosity.
