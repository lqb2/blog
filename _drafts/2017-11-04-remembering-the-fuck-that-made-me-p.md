i need to write this so i do not forget but i really don't want to. 

2 nov 2017 i found out from my doctor at fenway health that i'm hiv positive. of course, my brain has been doing unreal tricks and rethinking, feeling guilty, stupid, silly, etc. one thing that has been happening is reliving the moment that i believe i contracted.

it was with a guy who i actually quited liked. 

like.

he's been a great submissive partner and one time i made the mistake of hinting that he could top me.

the next play session we had (4 oct 2017) i wasn't gonna cum while topping so i went in the shower to clean out so he could try topping. i was somewhat excited because i do like bottoming and hadn't for a while. 

once we got going, it was definitely not fun. i'm a pretty gentle top and even though i definitely like pounding occastionally, i'm more interested in long, sensual strokes because that's what makes my dick feel good. 

he, on the other hand, is one of those brutal, restraining tops and really likes to make it hurt. i think it both works for his dick and he enjoys that type of domination. 

looking back, there were several moments when i clearly said stop. he just wanted to keep going and, in a way, i did, too. there's a point in bottoming when things go from hurting to feeling good and we hadn't gotten there. i wanted to get to a point where it did, but it just wasn't happening.

i remember one line he said that in hindsight feels so awful. "don't resist me. i like fucking hard but if you tell me it hurts, i'll stop. i promise." there was part of it that was hot, but most of it was like... wtf? don't say that shit.

anyway, we changed positions a few times and at some point he hit my back wall and i felt like lightning hit my body. i was on my back and making eye contact with him and when he saw my body freak the fuck out he pulled out and apologized profusely and we stopped. i can't remember if we went back to fucking later or not, but eventually we both did cum and went to sleep. 

i'm not yet mad but i can imagine that it might happen. i just feel so awful. i haven't bareback bottomed in several years. how is it that the ONE FUCKING TIME i do i contract hiv? 

and i was actually thinking mike and i might have some sort of romantic future beyond just really great (except for this time) sex. he had made hints at telling me something but didn't want to tell me while he was high (oh yea, he only comes over to play when he's on crystal meth. i guess that should have been a telltale sign, right? ugh. i'm an idiot. i know self-blame and looking back isn't gonna help anything but i gotta do it at least a little bit, right? damn.). i was thinking he was gonna tell me that he was interested in dating... but now i wonder if he was gonna tell me if he was poz. 

fuck.
