[scene 1]

i was in a plane but somehow like sitting on the nose of the plane. or maybe the plane had front seats that were exposed to the air? either way, there was no one in front of me and the plane was landing. we were coming into boston harbor and somehow just really low. the pilot was flying the plane like right between ship masts and stuff. sitting up front i kept thinking and even saying to other passengers, "we're really gonna hit something if she's not careful." 

as we got near the runway to land, we suddenly took off into the air again. somehow it was sort of like a vertical lift off, not so much horizontal. we flew up through the clouds and i saw the city from way high up. 

[soft wake up where i realize we're actually still flying]

[scene 2 - important detail: i fell asleep with sleeping at last playing on my headphones]

i was in a super beautiful idyllic series of scenes being video-taped. well, i think i was just living life with some friends and everything was clearly being recorded by a big camera we could all see. [begin lucid dreaming] and all of a sudden, i was controlling the camera and where it went. it was in wilderness with a bunch of friends and green forest and water and earth. 

[wake up to initial descent]
