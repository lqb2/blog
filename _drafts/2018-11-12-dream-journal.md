[scene 1]

i was walking around in some courtyard and sort of crouching in a raised planter bed/divider thing. i was looking for something i'd lost that belong to d a v e  m a d a n, a mug or a hat or something. some rich woman had just bought a house from someone else and the memory of that was somehow repeating in my head. 

[scene 2]

i was going around some dark town square with d a v e. at some point, we split up and i had the feeling we'd meet back up but we didn't confirm details. 

i went into some board game (ish) store and started playing with modular triangle and square building systems. i was charging my phone on a outlet near the front. at some point someone came in to fight me for some reason and i beat them. they were standing ont he other side of some wall and i punched them hard through an opening in the wall. the wall was dividing the store's main aisle between and creates a front and back of the inside of the store. after i punched them, the wall fell down and there was a whole dojo floor of martial artists. they were all facing me and doing their dojo's group chant to scare me. they all kicked and punched in sync and then wove their arms together (sort of like the tri-delts sorority handsign) and talked about strength being together. i just walked away back to the front of the store to get my phone and leave. somehow it was 3am by then. 

the storekeeper turned out to be d e v i n  b a c h. i somehow showed up in his apartment and was in his kitchen. he came out from this back room and was wearing just a red thong but his junk was out and it was pulled to the side in the back so i could see his whole butt. he started trying to eat all this food but also said he was sleepy. for some reason, i started to take the food away from him and tell him i'd bring him something. i put most of it back in the fridge because we noticed ants on the counter [maybe processing the ants in d a n y a  s h e r m a n's apartment from last week?]. 

when i went to the bedroom, there was d e v i n and two older viking looking guys [wow probably DTx420 from c a m 4] and a woman [yesterday i kept finding this one guy's blog and he was bi and there were so many women on it]. they were all having sex and came really quickly. i didn't get involved. 

i went back to the front, which somehow was the game store again, and d a v e was there.
