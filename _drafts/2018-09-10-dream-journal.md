preface: when i woke up, the emotions from this dream were very strong. i set my alarm for 430a so that i could beat d u n c a n to work so he wouldn't wipe my computer which had my book draft on it. but i fell back asleep and woke up again at 7 and it was in that chunk of time where my dream happened. and while checking my email to see if duncan had emailed me back (so i could stop stressing out) i saw an email from wmbr saying that i didn't submit any volunteer hours. that was stressful because i *did* submit all my volunteer hours on friday evening. i guess something went wrong while i was on the wifi network from upstairs? ugh! very stressful morning.

i was laying on a bed in the dusp common room with z a c h  a v r e. we were being flirty and looking out the window. at a certain point, he started to get a little pushy and tried to kiss me but i refused. then he started getting more aggressive. i stayed on the bed but kept refusing him. he pulled out what looked like a cigarette [maybe it was dave m's little cigarette bong thing?] that had some coke on the end of it. he snorted it and then started to be *really* aggro. at that point, i got up and started to run away. he was still sort of in a daze for a bit and i made out of the common room and down to the first floor. he started chasing me and as i started to get towards the start, i started to be able to fly as well as things slowed way down [maybe that was what it felt like to fly? maybe falling in slow-motion **is** how humans fly?]. i made it out the lobby 9 door before he got to me and somehow got to a phone where i was calling for help...
