preface: i think i got a two in on deal with the alochol last night. i had a half glass of rose and i think the sugar content in it was high enough to make the dream stick. went to bed around 1145p

i vaguely remember being in some desert terrain in what felt like an abandoned town. maybe it was similar to a drier version of california during the parable series. 

all i remember now are two scenes but i know there was a lot more...

scene 1: in the group of people i was in, people kept going out to a garden shed or tiny house or something and a person who was hiding under a low table at the back of the house kept shooting people in the legs. i can't remember if the people would fall and die, but i know more people kept going out to figure out what had happened to the others.

scene 2: it was my turn (even though somehow i was watching all the other people go out and get shot) but when i went, i stooped down and looked under the table. i don't remember seeing the person but i remember seeing a long barrel of a gun and the person was shrouded in what could've been silk curtains for a bed with a canopy.

and that was it.
