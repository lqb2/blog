i was flying towards some trees, talking to myself about how much i was upset that djt was still the president. i flew into some branches towards the trunk of a tree and then pushed off the trunk to keep flying in a different direction. i was flying over a large field of grass and a small farm. 

at some point, i flew down to the farm to be with some people. i don't at all remember who the people were but i know they slowly started getting picked off. 

i started running, maybe for fun or exercise up a easy-sloped hill. as i got to the top, i started noticing really intense rain clouds. i shouted up the hill to a friend/person i was running towards and they noticed the storm  clouds i was warning them about. eventually, we turned and started running back down the hill but then the rains started to come, hard and fast [it started raining pretty hard overnight]. the person who was way behind/higher than me on the hill, somehow got lost in the rain and i think drowned. 

as i kept running back towards the farm house (not flying for some reason? maybe it's dangerous to fly in a storm?), i noticed more people all running for safety. 

eventually, we got down to the farmhouse [ah, this is interesting because i did a lot of talking about vermont and camping yesterday by text and email]. somehow, we were all breathing underwater and gathering/counting ourselves [when i snapped out of the dream in real life, i woke up kinda sweaty]. we realized we were missing some people and one of them actually floated down to us in a natural crevice in the land that went straight to the farmhouse door which we all were in front of. 

i walked up towards the body and started pulling it back towards us.
