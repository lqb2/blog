i was inside a house, i think the maine house. cameron was inside with me filling up what appeared to be a deep fireplace in the hearth of the house. she just had a hose and was pouring water into the hearth. she looked back at me and said something like, look how great they are out there. and out there was asa lying on his back and damani leaning over him making him smile and giggle like crazy.
