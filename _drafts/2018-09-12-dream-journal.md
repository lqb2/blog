preface: i told katherine that reading the particular section of the power i was reading was nightmarish. and, of course, i had an actual nightmare afterwards. it was weird because it was kind of lucid and i'm not sure it's a legitimate nightmare if it's lucid but still... called it!

also, i had a lot to drink before bed. a beer at jaho and then two cocktails with m a t t h i a s at a place i've never been to before called the ghost walk. he and i had a fun date so maybe it's most likely that the guy at the bedside was him.

the dream took place in a house that i can't quite make out the details of. i was lying on a bed in a small bedroom with a friend who i can't quite remember. maybe it was t a n k? or m a t t h i a s? either way, we were talking and he was sitting first on the floor next to the bed and then on the chair next to the bed that was seated at the computer. he started like... burning cds or something which i thought was weird, but who am i to judge? we were listening to music but the music stopped when he got on the computer so i pulled out my airpods, put them on the laptop keyboard that was with me on the bed and turned up the sound really loud. surprisingly, i could hear the music playing well. i asked if he could hear it to and he could so they ended up working as speakers. weird, eh? 

at some point, i got up to go the kitchen. on the way, i realized there were two other people in the house, a large black woman and a black man. i didn't pay much attention to either of the at first, but after i found the kitchen and was headed back to the room with my friend, i noticed that the woman was tied up (ankles bound and wrists bound) and lying on a bed. she was also gagged and trying to get me to stop and save her but i knew that wasn't the right time. i got back to my room, told my friend what was happening and then we started to make moves. 

i started paying attention to the sounds in the house of the other guy moving around. i grabbed my pocket knife (the one i keep in real life on my nightstands), signaled to my friend that we should ambush the guy when he tries to take the woman to the car (which i somehow knew he was gonna do), and then went back to the kitchen. for some reason, this time i went to the basement and opened a fridge there. the kidnapper came by and we were talking while i held the fridge door open, pretending to look for a snack. inside the fridge was a lot of apples, many lying in a glass casserole dish. the kidnapper and i exchanged words about what snacks i was looking for, but i was really just trying to get a sense for where he was going in the house next. 

eventually, he walked off and i started to try and follow him. i had my knife and was ready and then...
