all i remember was picking up a book i was reading (either _you are not a gadget_ or _the dispossessed_) and being **so** pleasantly surprised that i was 5/6 of the way through. i was happy because it meant i was reading a lot and fast. 

[wake up]

it was interesting because in real life, i've been thinking about how much more i want to be reading.
