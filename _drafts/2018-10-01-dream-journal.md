[dream 1] 

i was sitting on some living room floor with one other person, i think a woman, playing a video game. there was an older person, maybe an uncle or something, also sitting in the room but on a couch. at some point, he asked how the game worked, specifically about how the world got reset every time. 

i started explaining it and somehow found myself tripping over my words as i did. i was trying to use a paper envelope as an example and it was just a really clumsy explanation. i was talking about how the game world was like... in the envelope and when you started the game each time, you got a new envelope which was the same basic setup as the previous envelope but totally new. [interesting because i've been trying to buy some envelopes for my business and i was trying to find some yesterday at cvs but couldn't find any]

[dream 2]

i was on the air at wmbr running a show and playing lots of jazz from records and spotify. at some point i realized i had fallen asleep and then when i woke up i was no longer playing music. the entire control room (a-control) was dark and someone else was on the air from b-control. i turned everything back on and noticed that i had gone off the air at 7:44 and brian sennett, station manager, had send a virtual message at 7:48 using the wmbr texting service that i should press the heal button. i had never seen or used the heal button [but i know healing exists in audio editing software like adobe audition and i also am trying to do more healing work these days...]. 

after getting all the lights and everything working again, i tried the heal button. it took a few times but eventually everything started working like it should. the records stopped skipping and all the electronics stopped freaking out. but i couldn't decide if i should get to go backon the air on not. the woman in control-b was looking pretty set up and i had less than ten minutes left if i was to even come back. i felt really torn about it and walked in and out of a-control several times, debating whether or not i should even ask. eventually i decided to not ask and just head out. 

on the way out, i saw a new member getting trained. a young-middle-aged black guy sitting on a laptop in the master control room. he was typing and talking to someone who looked like they were training him but then they walked away and he kept talking. i felt strange about that and then... 

[wake up]
