preface: last night i had two beers (lucifer, black, 8.5%), two bowls of soup, and some salad, all at heidi & sutton's third thursdays dinner party. the conversation at dinner touched on many things, but landed a lot on sci fi. also had like 1/3 pint of talenti dark chocolate chunk gelato while upstairs checking in with shoshana.

i was with mom and ren at some relative's house. they were inside and i was laying out on some porch that was pretty high up, facing the water and broader city. i could see out to the city in front of us and another city/town across a river to the far right of us. everything had a sim city 3000 aesthetic. 

the city on the right was clearly having a lot of big activity on it, but i didn't know in the moment what it was. i was mostly paying attention to the book i was reading, but i definitely saw that stuff was happening in the other city. 

mom and ren came out and said it was time to go and then one of them or someone else pointed out at the alien attack was getting too close for comfort. then when i looked back at the other town, i could see what was going on for what it was: an alien attack on a city. one of them made a joke about how calm i had been while reading but that made sense since i didn't realize it was an alien attack. 

at that point, i said to them that iwanted to go next door and say bye to dad, just in case things got real crazy. they said ok. 

as i went next door, the alien attack started spreading and clearly getting worse. more fires, more big ships and like... gundam things but rounder and cuter (like wall-e + sim city 3000). i somehow walked into a room that looked like a hotel room that dad had and then we talked for a bit. 

then i had to go to the bathroom while he was getting ready. i went to pee [and in real life, i literally wet the bed. full bladder dump. ugh. wtf].

then i said it was probably time to go and it became that i was supposed to leave with him. 

somehow he kept taking forever and things kept getting worse and closer with the attack. at a certain point, we went outside to get in the car he had rented and somehow, the lock box forthe car key was at a low battery (?!) and somehow that meant that we couldn't leave. 

at that point, i started freaking the fuck out. outside things were going nuts. there was some big, bright green train that goes along the river that was clearly on fire and lots of people were running around. i was super frustrated with dad, not yelling, but i viscerally remember the feelings from childhood of being late and waiting on him to be ready.
