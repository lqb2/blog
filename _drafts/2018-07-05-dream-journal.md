preface: i'm up in waterboro for the fourth of july tradition with the 40 cottage family, but it's just me, annemarie, ben, roy, robin, and dylan. yesterday, i had lots of alcohol (one gimlet, two beers, two glasses of cider) over the course of the day and we all had two pieces of strawberry rhubarb pie with roy's homemade whipped cream for dessert. i went and slept in the house next door because the mosquitos were too bad in the upstairs sleeping spot of the maine house.

i was at someone's apartment in what felt like cambridge or somerville. we were sitting around at a table and we first ordered lots of pizza and then had too much pizza. and then we ordered lots of dessert and had too much dessert. i had decided to leave but there were still a bunch of people sitting around the table eating platesand plates of dessert and telling stories (one woman who looked like marcela angel was talking about how her family finally realized they had a shitton of privilege). as i walked back from the kitchen across the entry hall to the bedroom in the back, we all heard two gunshots [we've been hearing lots of gunshots on the lake this week] and i dove into the hallway in the bedroom to try and avoid getting shot from a stray bullet. eventually, when i thought it was all clear, i came out and was going to leave when i saw that everyone was lined up and a robber was calmly going to each person and taking all their info down. it was my turn and so i just stood there, feeling defeated, and started giving him my stuff and my info [i realized yesterday that i forgot to give leo the info he needs to buy my plane ticket for grist to seattle]. at some point, he turned around to go outside to the semi-truck he had parked outside. it seemed like he had lots of stuff in the truck and maybe that's where all the stolen stuff was? as he walked away, i ran and hid my allet in the bed comforter so he wouldn't get it. i still remember regretting having my phone in my pocket, though. 

while he was out there, this crew of college kids walked by and two girls stopped and i got to ask them if this guy had taken their stuff, too. they said yes and that somehow gave me the courage to tell everyone in our group, about 12 people, that we were going to start a rebellion. but then when the guy started walking back, i said "or at least we're gonna try." i looked and realized that the two girls had walked off and were going along a different street (somehow we were outside on the sidewalk now) to catch up with their college crew. 

and the next thing i know, the truck is driving off and it's a different truck. 

me and the group somehow slowly started walking, trying to figure out where the truck was going. i was trying to strategize with my group, talking about needing good allies, someone important who would come be with us and make the story important or newsworthy.

[scene change] 

we're at a normal-sized house in the woods and i run around back to pee. somehow it's the thief's house. as i'm peeing, the robber runs around the back of the house to do something but doesn't see me. as he went back to the front of the house i walked behind him and looked into the garage and there was the giant semi-truck with all the stuff. i can't remember if the group was there or not, but i remember looking into the garage window and feeling really relieved. 

next thing i know, i'm standing in the front yard and there is a pack of dogs running towards us. i was initially afraid and jumped into the arms of the thief. when i landed there, it turned out he was beautiful. he had pretty eyes, very darkly tanned skin, and a slightly furry chest. i was intensely attracted in that moment [i had been texting dustin all day and even talking about going on a kayaking trip with im again down in florida]. and then all the dogs started coming around and i realized that they were his. two more came out of the house including a dachshund and a cat with humongous eyes. 

somehow we were sitting with our backs to the wall of the house and petting the animals. me and the thief were next to each other and i kept looking in the cat's eyes and seeing so much depth and the openings were huge with detail. and one of the many openings in the cat's iris was shaped like a sharingan. me and the thief kept going back and forth about how to properly pronounce sharingan. 

[wake up]

and then i laid in bed trying to think my way through the whole dream so that i could get up and write it down. and i had forgotten my computer in the other house so i had to make sure it was really crystalized before getting up. now i need to go either do morning pages or meditate for my hour. but we're leaving at 9 so i want to make sure i'm not holding up the group packing process... i'll meditate first. it's only one missed day of morning pages.
