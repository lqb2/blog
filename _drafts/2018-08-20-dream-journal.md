preface: this dream was VERY intense and very long. i started dreaming after getting up to pee around 6am. it had several moments of lucidity. i want to write down a lot more about it but i am actually crunched for time and get working this morning...

the dream started off with me in a house. the house was michael bunne's house and he and his mom was there as well as lots of other people. i was visiting and staying there but it was my last day of staying. 

i was packing up my room when i heard it was time for lunch or dinner. i went out into a crowded (or just small) kitchen and anita bunne prepared a plate for me. michael got one, too and we were talking in the kitchen. 

at some point, i went outside and ended up across the street looking into some garden. i had super hearing and was listening to a town clock tick-tock like a mile away and over a hill. the garden had trellised cucumber plants i was telling bunne about how much i liked that cucumbers all grow exactly the way. each plant we were looking at had exactly the same leaf structure and places where flowers became cucumbers. [it was weird actually]

at some point, i noticed a car in a driveway near us and there were two women in it trying to call a tow truck to remove the car that had parked behidn them. the car belonged to a gay male couple who had seemingly abandoned it, blocking the women's car in. people in the house were trying to call and find them, but no one could. 

somehow, that triggered me remembering that i had to fly back either to or from europe that night and the time was near! when i checked my itinerary on my phone, the flight was in an hour!!! i panicked, called a lyft, ran in the house, grabbed whatever of my stuff i could snag quickly and got on. on the way to the airport, i got in contact with bunne and my mom and eventually gave up tyring to make it to my flight on time. i needed to be at the aiarport extra early so i could do the international flight check-in and i just clearly wasn't gonna make it [this is connected to how i felt going to and from paris at the airport, like i was maybe gonna miss my flight because the lines to check-in were so long, both in boston and paris, and the airline didn't have online check-in so i had to stand in line even if i wasn't checking any bags]. 

eventually, i got dropped off somewhere and got in my mom's car. she was trying to tell me it would all be fine but i realized that the lyft was on its way back to bunne's house to drop my stuff there. but i was in my mom's car and she wasn't listening that i needed to go back to the house. she was really not interested in listening to me and i started to throw a full on temper tantrum, like 8-year child style [i wonder if this was brought on by the 'mapping our ecosystems of care' conversation i hosted yesterday. i definitely know it was related to talking about gatekeepers, both at e.l. and with jess recently].

[wake up]
