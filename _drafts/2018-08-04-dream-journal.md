it was in the morning back at my old house in tallahasee or something like it. mom, dad, and ren were all around. i was packing up and getting ready for the day and started to make toast but someone else was making toast first. the person had cut three slices from a loaf of bread and it blew my mind! ihad never thought of cutting three slices of bread. i had only ever cut slices in even numbers. i immediately did the same thing and waited for the previous person's bread to toast. it wasn't any of my family members. 

as i was waiting, we were listening to npr; i think krista tippett with on being. 

and then i checked the clock and realized it was like 817a and i had to get to the podcast garage; it wasn't going to just be a normal dropoff like my mom usually did for me and my brother to school. i started complaining and my dad came out, looked in the fridge, and then went back to the bedroom. and, for some reason, i had the sense that i wasn't actually going to be late but i was using the travel to the podcast garage as an excuse to build urgency or to just figure out my own way to get going for the day. 

as i started to toast my bread, i was putting together food to bring to a course i was going to teach. i was looking for bananas and apples. i found some bags of both but i also found some brownies. i was thinking, well what if someone wants bananas but it allergic to them. or what if they just want something sweeter than fruit. then i spent a long time playing container tetris, trying to put these little small chocolate covered bananas in a small plastic container. the lid was in a strange way and i kept playing with fitting the tiny bananas in and fiddling with the lid until the lid actually came into four pieces and wouldn't close anymore.
