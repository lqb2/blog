preface: over the course of my evening at home, i had three glasses of shitty moscato (2/6$ from the bodega). i also had my oreos and milk before bed. i also had an hour 1h17min phone convo with nene right before bed, mostly about relationship things with b****** at cooperation jackson and another woman in atl who is also interested in him (as is she). 

[begin dream]

it was a gray day and i was on the beach. there was a medium-sized wooden shack made of really dark wood, like driftwood colored. as i stepped in, i saw nene. she told me to grab a shotgun so i did. and then a woman in a red dress started trying to enter the house through the closed door i had just come through. we started shooting her. the shots came slow from the gun (i guess they were old) but they were definitely hitting the women. her body flashed/flickered like it was a video game. i think it took four shots over the course of a few minutes to finish her off. we calmed down a bit and then a guy started trying to come in from the door on the opposite side of the shack. as we were shooting him, the shots looked like they went into real flesh. his body didn't flash like a video game. i started getting really scared but eventually we finished him off. then another woman came in and we repeated the shooting. i can't remember if nene and i were talking or not. as the 2nd dude started to come in and i felt like i had to run so i ran out the back door of the house. i ended up running up a beach cliff with hewn steps and found my way into a one of those standard beach restroom buildings. i started peeing but knew in my mind that i wasn't just running away because i had to pee. i ran because i was scared.
