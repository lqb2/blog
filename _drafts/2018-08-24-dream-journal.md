i was sitting at the edge of the ocean in a beach chair [the ocean scene makes full sense because yesterday i was on a boat with dave madan and his siblings and i spent lots of time trying with my feet in the water or actually just swimming in the water, trying to drink in the moment and store it so i could travel back to it as the fall and winter arrive]. i was sitting next to someone but i don't know who it was. i was looking out into the ocean watching people do all the normal things folks do in the ocean: swimming, frolicking, standing around and talking, trying to find things in the water/sand. 

as i was looking out, i kept noticing a strange phenomenon. the people at the horizon either (a) became really large again, like i was looking at them as if they were at my edge of the water, but they were clearly at the horizon. or (b) instead of getting into deeper waters, they were just standing up [this feels a little familiar because of how sandbars work at florida beaches]. 

i was confused so asked the person sitting next to me and they explained what was happening but i didn't really understand it. it was something about how the horizon edge of the water here was actually attached to another part of another (or the same, i can't remember) ocean. 

i remember wanting to try it out but i also wanted to eat the watermelon i had brought with me [this happened yesterday on the boat *and* i actually still have the watermelon and i'm concerned about it not getting eating before it rots when i back from nyc next week]. i sliced it somehow into really thick chunks and started eating it. i can't tell if this was a lucid part of the dream or not. either way, i remember starting to bite into it and then... 

[wake up]
