i was sitting with christine c. and bernice s. in an office somewhere and i was asking them what computers they had. they both had the 'mac world.' it was a startling hybrid between the macbook air and what seemed like old looking pc laptops. and when they each showed me their screens, the computers were running WINDOWS XP. i was stunned. but also so curious about why they *both* had them... [this is super interesting because i've been debating when to buy a new laptop with the money from my last consulting gig and i think i'll probably go today].
