location: 36 claremont park
bedtime: ?
alcohol: two glasses of red wine at my place with ashe, rebecca, and jay and then two foolish pleasure cocktails at five horses tavern. 
sugar: n/a

preface: this is the first dream i've had in maybe years where i imagined having sex. the crazy thing was that (a) i was literally cuddling with a guy who i had just jacked off with and (b) when i woke up from the dream, we actually then proceeded to have sex. 

---

in the dream, we were cuddling and then, already being naked, we just started touching each other and ended up with me starting to fuck him doggy. at some point, we decided to get up and go to the other room. as we started to walk through the door [which i didn't remember what it looked like on the other side]... 

[wake up]

sidenote: i wonder if i won't up in the dream at that moment _because_ i didn't know what it looked like on the other side of the door. or maybe i woke up because the guy started touching me in real life...
