[setting]: i was with the fraternity but we were somewhere out in the woods in a small hotel feeling building. i think it must have been retreat. it was two floors and all the rooms were upstairs, hotel style. we took the elevator to go up and down. my room was huge and at one end of the hallway. i was in it solo and the bed was over in the corner and there was just lots open space in the room. there was also an open window with no screen looking out into the forest. 

[scene 1]: at some point, i was standing in the door frame of the elevator, looking out into the big open room the elevator opened into. there were stairs down from the elevator [which is weird now that i think about it] but i was clearly a little elevated. 

at some point, i saw ben mayne and i walked up to talk to him. he was talking with someone else who i don't remember and when i walked up, he sort of shooed me away and then walked some feet away with the brother to keep talking. i felt hurt but waited for what felt like a while and then approached again. i said something like... "what's going on here?" he said we should talk and then all of a sudden it came to me: "you're kicking me out?" he said yes andthen we had a conversation about how i'd made some mistakes that couldn't been forgiven. particularly, there was something about having made a bad pick during rush and giving someone in the house who "wasn't a good fit for the house" a bid. there was a specific name but i can't remember it anymore [i imagine it was a stand-in for greg].

[scene 2]: i'm at the elevator, headed back to my room, walking with ben, wanting to have more conversation about this. i started processing my feelings with him, but i don't know if he asked about them. i started telling him i felt sad and about all the ways the house still connected to my identity as a person. "in spite of the fact that i don't hang out there much, the house is still a part of me and i tell people about it all the time." i went in my room to grab my knitting so that we could go outside to talk and i could do something productive during the chat. 

at some point, the person i was talking to was vince, not ben mayne.  we were in the elevator, on our way downstairs and vince was telling me that this place used to be a wal-mart. for some reason that made a lot of sense to me. someone tried to run down the hall and get into the elevator with us (the elevator was around a corner in the hallway so we didn't get to see who it was; we just heard them). we got downstairs and i told vince i had to shit real bad (and i really felt it) but i'd meet him outside when i was done. the elevator this time opened to what seemed like outdoor/indoor terrain. there was a little (like 6-10 inches tall) roped barrier right outside the elevator door (no steps this time). it was sitting on concrete and there were pine needles and leaves around. vince just walked right over it but i went to the end because i wasn't tryna lift my leg given that i had to poop. he laughed and then let me walk my way towards the bathroom.

[wake up]
