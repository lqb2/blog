preface: i woke up to pee around 5 and thought to myself, i'm gonna dream soon. when i got back to sleep and then woke up again, i couldn't actually remember my dream or even if i had dreamed. i tried to tap back into sensation like i did the other day but it didn't work. after a few minutes of trying i just got up and went to go pee and then start my morning routine. i looked in my medicine closet to try and find some decongestant and i saw my giant ibuprofen bottle and *that's* what triggered my memory of the latter scene in the dream taking pills from my backpack bottle of ibuprofen. and then as i started to remember the second scene, i remembered the first scene. **fascinating!**

[this part of the dream only came back to me after writing the part after the scene change]

i was in an apartment with some folks and at one point i remember sitting at table with curtis o g d e n and danielle c-c. we were talking about how much capacity we had to do certain work and i have a felt sensation of overcommitting and regretting it. there were lots of sheets of paper with pink highlighter written on them. 

at some other point during this scene, we were watching tv and something major happened. i didn't ever get a full sense but it was smething to the effect of france and england (or another country next to france) trying to merge together. people in the streets were freaking out and that's what the news was about. 

i must have been in france because i went downstairs and outside, i think to buy something, and also to see all the commotion. when i went outside, there were lots of people penned up, all basically being held by the police and processed through some giant facility. maybe it was concentration camp, maybe it was a deportation center. but i definitely remember walking through the street feeling fine and not even looked at and not really understanding why. but i guess i was some type of citizen that no one really thought could be doing wrong (#privilege) and i was just heading back to the apartment with a backpack and things i'd just bought. i distinctly remember hearing someone say that it shouldn't be like this and i remember thinking to myself "well, that's what happens eventually when you live in a police state." 

on the way back into the building, as i walked up the spiral but square stair corridor, i ran into erin who was trying to find the apartment we (me, danielle, etc.) were all in. eventually, danielle came out and all of us were in the hallway. i think the two of them went back to the apartment, maybe with the snacks and things i'd bought, but i walked downstairs and into a door that was a different room...

[scene change]

i was in a large den-like room with lots of people my age, maybe 50 people. the room was long and it was lined on all the edges with couches. people were sitting on the couches and on the floor. we were, all eating cookies and fruit on plates and lots of conversations were happening. 

at one point, i was talking to a guy i had a crush on [in the dream i knew exactly who he was in my real life but i can't remember right now]. as we got into our conversation, he said something i disagreed with. i tried to disprove what he was saying by talking about the way shape culture by the way we teach kids in kindergarten what's normal and not. and that if could just change what they think is normal, culture would shift. he couldn't disagree with me but he had some other point to make about how his mom accidentally outed him to the broader community as hiv positive. someone who knew he was positive told her and then she told everyone. and he was pretty hurt about it. [maybe this is connected to my own fear of telling my mom what's up?] for some reason, while we were talking, the whole rest of the room got very quiet. all the other conversations died down and people were just eating or on their cell phones. just as i was about to get my cellphone out to play music from it, someone sitting directly across the room in front of us two, started playing music from their phone. 

next thing i know, i'm talking to cameron or keely curliss to my right and taking pills from the ibuprofen bottle i carry with me. she was saying i should take some to not get sick [which in real life i am sick and have felt like i was getting sick for days]. i knocked the whole bottle back, just trying to get two pills, but i accidentally got the whole bottle [suicidal ideation inspired by reading philip's blog?]. i looked at someone to my left and decided to spit all the pills (except 2) out into my hand and then dump the rest back into the bottle. the left person said "that's how you roll, eh?" 

next thing i remember is getting up and wanting to take people's plates and scraps to the kitchen. i got my plate and tried to get several people's plates (grape vine remainders are what i remember the most) and some people were done and some people were still working. i started making my way towards the front of the room and...
