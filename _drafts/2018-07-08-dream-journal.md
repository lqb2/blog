preface: i went on a long walk with dave earlier today (like 12:30-4:15) where we walked from his place to the esplanade, thru back bay, and then back to his house. we got salad bowls from a new mediterranean spot called 'noon' and also had ice cream sandwiches at his place. we were processing his breakup with devin and talking about the endings of relationships and life after love and how bad most people in our society are at ending relationships because we don't have good practices or rituals for it (we just throw people away mostly) and that's weird to both of us but we don't know much else to do about it.

dave madan and i were walking on some beach island in the middle of a large ocean. we were at the tip and walking up a hillon the island and the island was completely made of sand. it was pretty tall, too. and the island was pretty narrow with two dropoffs on each side of this ridge we were walking up: to our right it was basically a vertical dropoff and to the left was less steep but still pretty steep. neither side would be easily climbed from the ocean so it was good that we were climbing up the way we were. 

as we neared the top, dave looked like he wasn't paying that much attention and was walking too close to the right side dropoff. i said something to him, like he should watch his step, and he stepped too hard back to the left and fell. he then slid all the way down the left side of the island and into the water. and then he started drowning. i was freaking out but didn't go down to save him because i didn't want him, in his fear, to also drown me. i was yelling for help but no one was around that i could see. and then i was in some digital platform trying to ask someone to come help save my friend but it wasn't working either. maybe i was texting on my phone? but it seemed more like i was "in" the phone environment than just texting. and i was definitely just watching dave fail at treading water and try to keep coming up but swallowing more and more water. 

eventually, the digital device told me that he had stopped coming up to the surface. and i looked and he was just sinking. and then a minute passed and i was still texting to get some help. nothing. two minutes passed. and i realized i should have just called 911 the whole time but that didn't occur to me because we were on a weird island. three minutes passed and i started to think about how much brain damage he would have if someone saved him and revived him and would it even still be worth it for him and his community...
