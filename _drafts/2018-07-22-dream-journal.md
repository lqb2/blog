i walked into the back of some restaurant to meet my mom. she was on the phone in a weirdly small 1on1 booth. i sat down across from her and she indicated she'd be done on the phone in a minute and i should hang out and wait. it didn't seem like we were eating or even going to order food so i don't know why we were in a restaurant. 

at some point, i think i got on the phone with someone and was walking around in a strange open area right behind our table that my mom was facing. i was pacing in the big open, concrete area and i don't remember who i was on the phone with. 

eventually, i realized that i needed to do some gardening so i went out the restaurant side door to walk across the street to my garden plot. i did a couple of tasks: picked up four stalks of lavender that had been snipped previously but i had forgotten to puick up; looked at my tomatoes and chives (noticed four chive stalks were about to bloom); that's all i remember now but i did other things [this garden was like a huge 16'x16' version of the garden plot i have in jax's old yard]. 

i came back inside after all that and my mom was done on the phone. she made some joke about me not staying inside but i told her i had gardening to do and she got that. then we walked outside and i showed her the garden.
