preface: last night i had one beer at 7p, three double stuf oreos with milk, and two spoonfuls of ice cream before bed.

[begin dream]

i was in a classroom or on a front porch and overhearing two people talking. it seemed like one person who was listening could speak english. the person who was speaking was speaking spanish. for some reason, when they were talking to each other, i could understand the spanish. at some point, i tried to go up the person wh owas speaking spanish and have a conversation with them. but when that happened, ic ouldn't understand the spanish. 

so i walked away, the english speaker came back, and the whole scene repeated itself. i was standing far enough away to be just within earshot and i could udnerstand the spanish when i was far away. but this time when i walked up, i had a purpose. the person was saying too much all at once and for some reason it was important for me to try to help them split what they were sayinga as one long chunk into two chunks. but, again, i couldn't understand the spanish when i got up close. 

i was confused. 

[scene change]

i was in a small wooden cabin on a very comfy bed and annemarie was there. we were talking about people who lived on land and we got to talking about andrew and rita. for some reason, i was trying to tell annemarie that we had visited andrew and rita on this one plot of land but i couldn't convey it to her. the land had a house for andrew's parents at the bottom left side near a driveway and then we had to walk through a little chunk of woods and up a hill to the right to get to andrew and rita's land. 

then, for some reaosn, as i was trying really hard to explain this to her, she walked over and during the conversation just pulled up her short dress. it seemed like she was airing out her body and vagina. she wasn't showing anything to me on purpose, it was just claer that she wanted to get some air on her body. 

[and then i woke up]
