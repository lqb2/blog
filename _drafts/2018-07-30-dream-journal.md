location: 40 cottage street, downstairs bedroom
bedtime: 1:15a
alcohol: none
sugar: a tiny handful of frozen blueberries (in the freezer but picked from the maine house)

preface: i woke up at 6a and remembered lots of the dream, but went back to sleep until 630a and now remember much less. this is a dream i remembered i had and i didn't have any alcohol and only a tiny amount of natural sugar before bed. interesting data...

all i remember of this dream was that i was in a wal-mart and i was in some way helping people. i think there were kids/babies involved.
