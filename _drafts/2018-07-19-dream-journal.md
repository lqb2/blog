[scene 1]: i don't remember very much about this dream but do remember trying to convince someone to understand that there are multiple ways to "identify" a unique individual and those methods were by sight, by touch, and then by this last mechanism that was something like "by vibration." like... if you were in tune enough you could notice the frequency that people vibrated at and then know who they were even if you couldn't see them or touch them. [i think this is me processing some of the things said in gibr√°n's interview with cyndi on the first episode of his podcast]
