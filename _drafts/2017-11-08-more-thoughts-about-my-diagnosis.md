it's been almost a week since i found out i was poz. a few more thoughts here:

### i am so glad ambroise was here 

i don't know how that worked out so well, but it really did. i mean, maybe i would have just found someone else to latch on to. maybe i would have just dealt with it solo. who knows. anyways, point is: he was here and, as one of my woes, it was incredibly grounding to have him in town from paris. he was willing to come with me to the doc and he was also willing to not. he just wanted me to feel comfortable and safe and that was really nice. i love that guy. i don't know if i've ever said that to him, but i really should. 

### i began an obsession with bonsai and i think that isn't accidental

as ambroise and i walked through the arboretum on saturday (we walked about 4 miles sayeth my phone), we stumbled on [the larz anderson bonsai & penjing collection](https://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/plants/featured-plants/bonsai/). we were awestruck. i was especially awestruck. and i became obsessed almost immediately. before we even left the pavillion i was googling where to find bonsai around boston and how to learn about it. 

when we got home, we watched probably 30 minutes of bonsai videos on youtube, including [this slideshow about rosemary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_rwmVSHuVI). conveniently, i was working on a [rooting a bunch of cuttings](https://www.instagram.com/p/BZDydzxnlqJ/?taken-by=lqb2) from the rosemary plant in my garden.

i decided to start trying my hand at bonsai with them and so we went to the store and got a bunch of pots and together, we transferred them into soil in the pots. ambroise did most of it because he was really enjoying it, and i was happy to just transfer one.

over the weekend, i began reflecting, first to myself, then in conversation with him, about why i was so attached to this idea. it dawned on me that it likely had a lot to do with my diagnosis and wanting something to latch on to. i think having something to work on for many years feels grounding given the news. it is giving me something living to care for and hold onto, even through the winters. i think i'm releasing my stress into these rosemary bonsai. i know energy and affect are transferrable so i hope they can handle it. i imagine they can. mama earth's capacity to hold us is big. i know it's not infinite, but this seems ok i think. i guess we'll see.
