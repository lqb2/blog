[scene 1]: i was somewhere with joel and we had to travel to go somewhere else. each of us had a car and could have driven, but we each were hoping we could ride while the other drove. i really wanted to knit on the car ride but somehow joel won out. 

i don't remember anything about the journey, but when we arrived, i looked into the backseat where joel was and he was shirtless with his dick pointed up into his pants waistband and the head and some of the shaft were sticking out. he was tempting me to come back and play.

but then ambroise walked up to the car and both of us were a little worried about what would happen next... but then he just got on joel and straddled his stomach. i think we were in some the parking lot of some giant supermarket.

[scene 2]: it was a flying dream for sure and i think it was lucid! [i've been thinking to myself lately that i wanted to get good at lucid dreaming again and i knew that dream journaling was a way to help get there]. 

i was floating in space (like outer space space that was dark and there were stars around) with some guy and we were just chasing each other for a while. it seemed in good fun. and then all of a sudden we were floating/flying inside some house structure and he said that he was going to try to shoot me. but if i lasted long enough, i would be free. 

and then he somehow had a giant gun stationed on the top of what seemed like a crib with solid walls and started pointing the machine gun at me. i flew to the undersisde of the crib and just watched the bulletholes start to tear up the crib itself and the house around me. i'm not sure how i didn't get hit but i kept moving around sothat i didn't.

eventually, i made a break for it and started to try to fly away through other rooms of the house. i somehow felt sluggish while flying, i wasn't moving fast enough. flying was like swimming [woah, annemarie, ben, and i had a conversation about how life would be different if humans could fly and the one constraint we put on the situation was that flying would be similar to the way swimming is now] but i needed to go faster so i was pulling myself along by wall fixtures and door frames in the house. i was kicking and pushing myself forward using things in the house, too. eventually i got a big push away from my pursuant and got far enough into a room he wasn't in yet that i could pick from a few different room options and lose him. as i was moving myself towards a spot where i thought i could get away, i very very smoothly (smoother than has ever happened) woke up out of dream state. 

i should have tried to slip back in but i felt like it was time to get up to get ready for work. i still ended up lying in bed for a while because it was chilly (it's always hard for me to get out bed when it's chilly) so i should have just gone back anyways lol.
