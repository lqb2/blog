[scene 1]

i was talking with sam cronin (phone or text). he was broken up with kelsey and we were arranging a trip for me to come see him [which reminds me, i really need to get on top of planning that trip]. we realized the best way to make it happen was for me to fly down and then drive... 

[scene 2]

i was driving in a car with my dad through the south (presumably somehow on my way to see sam but it wasn't totally clear). somehow, next thing i know my dad and i are in a lake, still driving though. wasn't sure if the car was floating or what... because my dad can't swim, we were trying to get the car out of the lake. for some reason we both got out behind the life raft (which the vehicle had now definitely become) and were kicking our way to shore. as we got to shore, me and my dad were instantly joined by two other people who were helping us carry the inflated raft towards a clearing. once we got to the clearing, we threw the raft in front of us onto some sharp wooden stakes poking out of the ground. it deflated and that was that... 

[scene 3]

i was back in a car, driving myself (alone) towards sam's. eventually, i pulled over at a corner store and realized i was really near my grandma's house. as i pulled the car in, i could see her, standing on the wooden porch of her wooden house, looking down the road towards me. she was wearing a ankle-length long dress, slim, had a big fro, and was waiting on me. 

inside the corner store, i met a young woman who i found out very quickly was my cousin. i asked if she wanted to come see grandma with me and she said no but that i should bring something to her (i don't remember what that thing was).
