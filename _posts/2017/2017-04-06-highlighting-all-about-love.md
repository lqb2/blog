last year, i read bell hooks' [all about love](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17607.All_About_Love). i'm still reeling from the number of ways that it changed my life, but one of them is that it totally changed my "highlight" game (and by highlight i really mean just markup)! i've never read a book that i wanted to highlight so much. some times i would mark entire pages. 

early on in the book, these excess markup needs made my pages look really sloppy. eventually, i evolved into the system you can see in the below page. there are a few things that either aren't visualized here or that i figured out later, but here are the elements:

* **underline**: reserved for marking anything from a phrase up to an entire sentence, but no more than a sentence.
* **sideline**: for marking section. sidelines can be stacked. if like lines 4-10 on the page, but lines 4-6 especially stand out, i'll mark both. in effect, lines 4-6 appear double-sidelined. 
* **multi-page sideline**: a dotted sideline that begins and ends with square brackets indicates that the section marked continues onto the next/previous page. 
* **exclamation points**: one means the section marked needs to go into my [quote repository](http://lqb2quotes.tumblr.com/). two means it's social media worthy. three means the quote changed my worldview/life. 

that's what i've got for now. will probably continue to evolve. 

ps - tbc, sometimes the pages still end up looking a little sloppy, but at least they're legible in hindsight, heh.
