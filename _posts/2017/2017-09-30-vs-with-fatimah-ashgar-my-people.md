[fatimah asghar's interview on vs](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/podcasts/143798/fatimah-asghar-vs-the-people) was amazing. i think i've written about a few other things she said that stuck with me (but if i haven't, i will), but the thought for today is related to the way she uses the words "my people."

first of all, the poem she read, "if they should come for us" is fire and if you're reading this you should stop and go listen to it. [it's right here](https://overcast.fm/+JVd-4weNI/42:35). i even timestamped the link for you. ;) 

and i can't remember if this discussion came up before or after she read the poem, but at some point near it she said something along the lines of "'my people' is constantly changing group. even in this poem, there are people who other folks might not consider 'my people,' but i do consider them my people. in fact, my goal is to make 'my people' the biggest group possible."

that's a pretty rough paraphrase (and i might actually be blending in something frannie said) but i really do love that idea. by beginning/learning to expand the bounds of who i consider to be "my people," i'm moving closer to the world i think we are intended to live in. it expands who i can (and must) love, who i am responsible for, and who i am accountable to and vice versa. 

anyways, i could go on, but i'll leave it here for now.
