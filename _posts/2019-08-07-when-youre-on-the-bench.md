there is a really excellent section of this podcast where franny and danez, the two poet hosts of this (my favorite) poetry podcast, share their thinking about what it means to have a crew. i'm just going to drop the bullet points below, but you should listen for yourself if you want the ground truth. the link is timestamped to the part of the conversation i'm talking about. 

[Derrick Harriell vs. the Clock — VS — Overcast](https://overcast.fm/+JVd89_Qk0/39:17)

* people rise in crews/team/squads (sounds like the [scenius](https://austinkleon.com/2017/05/12/scenius/) to me)
* everyone on your team can't be in the spotlight all the time. people take turns. sometimes it's your year to shine. sometimes it's someone else's turn. 
* even when it's not your year to shine, you still have work to do. some of that work is the hidden, inner, personal work of actually working (which is different from shining). some of that work is shouting out the other people on your team. "just because you're on the bench, doesn't mean your team isn't winning.

i just love this analogy for thinking about my work and my approach to my work. it's not about me; it's about we. we rise, we fall, together!
