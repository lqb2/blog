what does a butterfly Ã¦ffect?

if everything is connected, who can say that the small movement of air of a quickly opened door didn't cause a hurricane?

have you ever cracked your sternum when you meant to crack your neck?

have you ever meant to sneeze but hiccuped instead?

the funny thing about a seed is that it's sort of like a human. once there's no more room on the inside, it can go no where else but out.

sometimes out looks like water. other times like fire.

how do we lose space on the inside of ourselves? what takes it away?

hard things. very hard things.

the funny about the hardest things is that they are so hard they leave no visible wound. they make no audible sound. they feel like nothing, like emptiness. which is the hardest of all.

hard things, can, though, be written on paper. apper which can be used for a million things. and a million years.

when a seed is out of the room on the inside, it goes in three directions. up and down, then out and around.

what might i learn here? when i'm out of inner space, what does reaching up and rooting down look like? once rooted and gathering lightfood, what does reaching out and around look like?

how might i, younger sibling to most seeds, find ways to go out to get what i need? to connect with every thing and everything?
