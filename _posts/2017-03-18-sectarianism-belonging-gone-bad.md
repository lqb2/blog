last thought inspired by [pádraig ó tuama's on being interview](http://onbeing.org/programs/padraig-o-tuama-belonging-creates-and-undoes-us-both/) (really this time). 

> sectarianism is belonging gone bad. 

pádraig cited this line from a book called [moving beyond sectarianism](https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/cka/Moving-beyond-Sectarianism-Joseph-Liechty/1856073181) by cecelia clegg and joe liechty. i've been thinking a lot about the notions of community and democracy and decision-making and culture, all as they relate to the size of the united states. although i think many different forces can encourage sectarianism, i think one that we're experiencing is a mismatch of scale. i'm pretty firmly in the camp that the u.s. is too large to have appropriately scaled decision-making processes. 

there are many impacts of that mismatch, but at least one of them i think is an inability to make empathetic decisions with someone in mind you can't relate to. lack of relateability in the u.s. context i think is caused by being too socially and/or physically far apart. given this, i think we could totally push for mechanisms and tools to close gaps of understanding so that we could make empathetic decisions. but if we don't intentionally do that, i think sliding into sectarianism is an obvious risk. 

this idea, about belonging going bad, also connects (for me at least) to john a. powell's [work on belonging](www.otheringandbelonging.org). belonging, done well, can be a beautiful thing. however, belonging too discretely to one community over any (or all others) makes collectivity difficult. 

so i guess one question is how to reverse the forces of sectarianism and strike a balance between individual, community, and "country" (if country is even a thing we should be thinking about)?
