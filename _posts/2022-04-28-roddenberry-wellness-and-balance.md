last year, i taught a 4-week (weekly 1h meetings) course for the roddenberry fellowship and i really liked it. i'm sharing it here because i'd love other folks to play with it!

agenda arc: 

**session 1: getting started**. what is/isn't wellness or balance? how do you know you do/don't have them? how do they show up at individual, organizational, community, and societal scales? 

homework: talk to someone about their experiences of these things. also, bring an example of someone who does these things well that you admire. 

**session 2: learning from our people and exploring a metaphor**. what lessons did you glean from your conversation(s)? pick a metaphor you'll use to seek balance or wellness. 

homework: what you notice about your life when you look through the lens of your metaphor?

**session 3: working our metaphors**. how can your metaphor help you practice staying with wellness/balance/sustainability?

homework: craft one experiment around an area of struggle using your metaphor. 

**session 4: tying it all together and looking ahead**. how was your experiment? what did you learn? what single practice can you commit to add to your system to help you stay well/balanced? who will you tell or involve in your learning? what accountability do you need?

a couple additional thoughts:

first, i chose to intentionally frame the course around individuals because i wanted to center the power of the individual leader (many fellows are at the top of their organizational hierarchies) to shift the ecosystem. but there is a whole other world of convo possible if you took wellness and balance to the collective/organizational level. 

second, during our debrief convo, [russ](https://russfinkelstein.com/){:target="_blank"} and [meg](https://ssir.org/articles/entry/experimentation_a_shortcut_to_innovation#){:target="_blank"} asked if i were to teach a next level of depth of this course, what might i focus on. i thought for a minute and then landed on these four pathways to deepening:

* family and lineage
* systems
* community 
* identity

if what i led in 2021 was the 101, these four pathways would be the 201 and each of them could get their own 4-week course. will i ever do that? i hope so! but for now, this is what i've got to share. if you're interested in playing with this, lmk (lawrence [at] lqb2 [dot] co) and i'll send you a copy of the facilitator agenda to play with. my only ask is that if you use it, you let me know how it worked and what you adapted!
