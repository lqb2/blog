i'm still in fortaleza and i have a few more thoughts from this trip so far. they're very random and probably won't make sense to anyone other than me. 

* some of the people i've met on this trip and convening are people that i definitely need to stay connected with (not in order of priority and not comprehensive): alvaro, sandra, ernst, danny, eddi, denise, yumeka, david. 

* **i am an old man.** this is knew, but i've fallen asleep twice at key party moments on this trip and it makes me really sad. i missed a giant music festival on the last night and i'm kicking myself for it. 

* i still have much to learn about facilitation in unstructured contexts. 

* when trying to have transnational conversations, people who have access (i.e. can pay for) to translation whenever they want are leaps and bounds of ahead people in different contexts who need to connect, but cannot do so without live translation. 

* even in brazil, i seem to gravitate to a similar type of guy. it's eerie.

* meditating (and writing, too) to the sound of the ocean is epic. the ocean and beach have been important to me for a long time and that hasn't changed. meditating for six mornings on the brazilian coast has been really good. feeling so lucky.

* i'm feeling so lucky and grateful to have been invited to help support this convening. i still can't believe i'm in brazil right now! :O :D
