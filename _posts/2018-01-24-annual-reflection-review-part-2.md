... but first things first: my two solo days of reflecting. 

in general, my rule (inspired by susannah conway's [unravel your year](http://www.susannahconway.com/unravel/) reflection structure) is to spend half my retreat looking back and the other half looking forward. so days 1 and 2 were devoted to that. 

maybe i should have kept better notes (maybe not), but the two days have sort of blended together for me. but the list of things tackled (and mostly accomplished) this year encompassed:

* reviewing my 2017 calendar, week by week (which took an entire day)
* reviewing my 2017 budgets (1/2 day)
* getting explicit about my [friend ecosystem](https://medium.com/@lqb2/planning-out-my-friend-ecosystem-95175246458d) and who's in them (1/2)
* reflect on the question: did how i live use my time and resources (i.e. did how i live) in 2017 align with my values? 
* revise and update my vision statement

that review, which was really challenging and eye-opening (as deep reflection often is), lead me to think very concretely about what i wanted 2018 to look like. so that kicked off days 3 and 4...

which i need to write about it tomorrow...
