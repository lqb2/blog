just i did back in elementary school to learn words for the first time, i've been working on my own personal definitions for words i often use in my work. the logic from back then still holds: you are more likely to remember something when you find a way to make it your own. 

this page will update over time. it was last updated on : 

ok enough intro! here are the words: 

* integrity: all parts being present (inspired by joyce shabazz)
* authenticity: when what i say, what i do, and what i think are all aligned (source: can't remember)
* strategic storytelling: sharing experiences in a way that moves an audience towards a goal
* values: a person’s principles or standards of behavior; one’s judgment of what is important in life (oxford dictionary via [how your story sets you free](http://www.millionpersonproject.org/how-your-story-sets-you-free))
* liberation: joy without fear
* freedom: "no fear." (nina simone)
* leadership: this one is actually worth a whole post...
* transformative: a process where a barrier is overcome by a radical change in the state of something
