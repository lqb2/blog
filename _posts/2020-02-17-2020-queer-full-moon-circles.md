“Challenge yourself to be a healer and activist for justice. Don't feel you have to choose one or the other. Be both. See activism as a form of social healing and interpersonal healing as a form of social justice. Transform and heal yourself as you transform and heal the world.”

— Fania Davis, [The Little Book of Race and Restorative Justice: Black Lives, Healing, and US Social Transformation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34145663-the-little-book-of-race-and-restorative-justice)

**who**: anyone socialized as a boy/man. circle is anchored by me (lawrence barriner ii). there may be other co-facilitators as desired/needed.

**what**: a series of healing-oriented gatherings where we will explore ways to connect with the emotional, physical, and spiritual parts of ourselves and each other.

**when**: (an evolution from [the 2019 circles]({{ site.baseurl }}2019/05/14/queer-full-moon-circles/)), these circles are offered in the spring and fall seasons. there are three circles per season.

*spring* - touch

* tuesday 7 april
* friday 8 may
* sunday 7 june

*fall* - grief

* wednesday 30 sept
* friday 30 october
* saturday 28 november

**where**: all of the spring circles will be at [the old oak dojo](http://oldoakdojo.com/). the first fall circle location is TBD. the other two fall circles will be at the old oak dojo.

**why**: to support healing and growth on the journey of unlearning toxic masculinity.

**how**: due to the depth of the work, attendance is required at two of the three circles for each season. 

RSVPing is required. to do so, please email lawrence.barriner.ii@gmail.com, and confirm:

* which season(s) you are RSVPing for
* which dates during that/those season(s) you can and can't attend
* how you racially identify (each circle will be majority POC)
