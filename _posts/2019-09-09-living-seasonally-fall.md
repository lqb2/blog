fall starts on sept 23! as i continue my practice of working to re-integrate/remember the seasons in my daily/weekly/monthly/yearly live flows, noticing seasons is a big part of that. in this post, i'll share thoughts about what i'm seeing as summer comes to a close and transitions to fall. 

* summer is a time of connecting with nature and my body and water. 
* fall is harvest season! busy busy busy trying to bring in the goodies produced by the work started last winter and cultivated through spring and summer. also students. good lordt! lol
