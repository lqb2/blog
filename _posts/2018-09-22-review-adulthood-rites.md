i think the main idea of this book is about how to handle difference. some other themes are family structure, conflict, consensus culture, the connection between genetics and destiny/purpose, and the question "what does it mean to truly, genuinely human?". if i implemented one idea from the book right now it would be to seek out difference as something that is irresistible, not something that is dangerous or repellent. how would i describe the book to a friend: "on the surface, this is a story about human survival after we've ruined our first shot and are given a second by some complicated aliens. beneath the surface, it's a story that explores what it means to be human and how we (do and maybe could differently) deal with difference."
