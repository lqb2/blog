preface: if youâ€™re curious in the evolution of this experiment/thought/practice, here are the last 4 posts about it: 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019.



so it's a *tiny* bit earlier than usual but... 

# happy no new things day!

celebrating no happy new things day is part of my commitment to slowing down so i can actually be in right relationship with fall and winter (at least as far as i understand them where i live). once no new things day has come, i say as much no as possible to new asks for my time, attention, or energy. i've found that, at least in my work life, things tend to **ramp up** in the weeks following summer. but when i say yes to new things, that creates a context where there's a bunch of new stuff competing with the things i've already committed to finish. i've learned that if i can say a lot of no during fall (and early fall especially), i can actually slow down by around thankstaking and then when winter comes around, i can actually be slow. which i've learned is a great way for me to be with the energy of new england winter. when it's winter, i have learned that i feel way better when i can do less, read more, have fewer commitments, spend more time inside being cozy (cozy, cozy). 

of course, there are exceptions to the no new things boundary (imho, boundaries are permeable; barriers aren't). they include things:

* i've already committed to but need more energy 
* that fit with/achieve several priorities of mine at once
* i could do that would **really** help someone out who i feel accountable to
* that feel value-aligned and contribute to my long-run individual, relational, or community wellness

sometimes there are other exceptions, but beyond those above, i try to keep exceptions to an extreme minimum. 

ok, that's it for now! it's wild to have been in this practice for x years but it's getting better and better each year. one year i heard someone who has this practice uses it to take the last two weeks of december off completely and i'm not there yet but like... squad goals. cause like... who **really** gets anything done during those weeks anyways?
