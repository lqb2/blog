* overly simplified perfect resource. they don't at all address the issues of extraction nor of the processes it takes to turn a resource into useful material. they do talk about miners (one of the tribes is a miner tribe), but they don't at all address how that tribe relates to the rest of the tribes. are we to assume that they're just fine being miners?
