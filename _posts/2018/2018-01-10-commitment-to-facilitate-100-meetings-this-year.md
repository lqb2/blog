i want to facilitate 100 meetings this year. 

i am saying that here (out loud) to hold myself publicly accountable as well as to "speak" the commitment into existence. i'm increasingly convinced that saying things out loud actually does have real power. 

i also think i want to use this post as a place to literally keep track of meetings. i'm not totally sure how i want to decide what is a "meeting" and what criteria need to be met for me to"facilitate" one, but for now, i'll say: 

* a meeting is a gathering of myself + at least one other person

* it only counts if it is explicitly stated that i am facilitating (by me or someone else)

that second thing matters, not because i think it's not possible to facilitate in a 1on1 meeting, but (1) how people in the meeting locate in relation to me is important for me to learn about my facilitation and (2) because what i specifically want to practice is holding space for a group. it's just a different type of complexity i think. and the muscle for holding space in that way is different than when you're half of the group. and as i'm writing, what's dropping in is that it takes a different type of attention to see the dynamic between two other people (and those people and me), not just myself and one other person. 

anyway, practice, right?
