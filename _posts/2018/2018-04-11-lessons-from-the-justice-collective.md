a couple of weeks ago, my day job had a retreat facilitated by [the justice collective](http://www.thejusticecollective.org/). i learned a shitton and  wanted to put up here some of the things i learned. partly because i want to be able to give credit where credit is due, partly because i want to be able to remember where i got shit from, and partly because i'm an external processor and processing things out like (verbal or via writing) helps me integrate. this post is mostly going to be stream of consciousness and may or may not make much sense. &shrug; 

i'm gonna write these thoughts in 10 minute chunks so it'll probably take multiple days to get through all the thoughts. 

* we did an excellent activity called **prism of light** where, in pairs, we each shared about something visible, perceptible, and imperceptible about ourselves. it's both an interesting relationship-building activity *and* it creates space for a useful conversation about how we know and don't know each other and how each person in the world has depth that we may never know or see without asking. 

* [danielle](http://www.thejusticecollective.org/our-team-2/) at one point dropped the term "biotech break" on us and i lost it. such a good word for today's cyborg realities. take care of your body **and** your technology. love it. gonna use it.

* quote/idea shared with us from [marjorie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mstamperkurn/): "the best teams need conflict." it's important for teams to not have people retreat and to not have people overwhelm others with their (relational, positional, or expertise-based) power. both of those suppress conflict and the best times actually foment healthy levels of conflict. why? because healthy, generative conflict helps people see their blindspots. it also helps us create more informed pathways forward. 

* in this graphic, i had never thought about cultural as inbetween the interpersonal and institutionalized levels, but i see it and like that framing. [need to ask TJC for graphic about internalized interpersonal cultural institutionalized structural oppression]

* [need to ask tjc about their equity vs equality graphic] 
i like this graphic because it shows the inequality of the terrain too. i'm torn about the fact that it makes all the people all the same height. the pro is that it doesn't imply that some individual people have actual deficits. the con is that, in my mind, people are actually different and that should impact what equity looks like and how we achieve it.
