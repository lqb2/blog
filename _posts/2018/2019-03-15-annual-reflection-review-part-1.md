i realized yesterday that i hadn't written much about my [annual reflection process]({{ site.baseurl }}tags/#annual reflection-ref). i wrote one post but it's more notes for me than anything. it's time to say some more, especially since that maureen and i are planning an annual retreat called 2020vision for next year (more info coming soon on that so email me if you're interested).

i don't know if i'll end up writing five posts about it like i did [last year]({{ site.baseurl }}2018/01/23/annual-reflection-review-part-1/), but right now i'm feeling the desire to break my thoughts up into **process** and **content**. i think for now i'll just "bullet" things and maybe do more narrative weaving later. 

## process

* this year, it worked out for me to rent a friend's apartment while he was traveling. ideally, i would have gone away from the city but this situation was just working out too well. my dream is to go away to a beautiful, quiet, natural place for my annual reflection retreat _and_ the minimum requirement is that i just not be at home. i need to be in a different space so that i don't/can't get distracted by little things that break up my spaciousness (like chores i've put off for a long time and now that i have four days, decide to do and eat up hours of my reflecting time). it's just a bonus if the space is beautiful and natural. 

* around october 2018, i picked my retreat dates. that's the point at which i had enough clarity about what my january was going to look like to feel good about choosing dates. 

* i started building a list of things to do in my phone/computer apple notes app basically as soon as i finished my retreat (january 2018 when i reflected on 2017). as i thought of or saw ideas for activities to do on retreat that would be helpful to my reflecting and planning, i added them to the notes file. i knew that this would create more things to do than i could ever have time for, but i wanted to have a full menu of things to chose from. 

* the week before my retreat, i started to narrow down what things i felt **needed** to get done on retreat, what things would be **nice** to do, and what things just probably wouldn't happen.
