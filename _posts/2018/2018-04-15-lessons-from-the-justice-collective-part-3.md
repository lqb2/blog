final post of reflections/lessons learned from the retreat [colab](https://www.colab.mit.edu/) had with [the justice collective][tjc] (this is part 3 [in a series]({{ site.baseurl }}tags/#the%20justice%20collective-ref)): 

* "sometimes the way queerness and blackness show up in the workplace is a forced and deep lack of awareness in queer or black or queer and black folks. we are systemically, historically responsible for the care of others and for managing their emotions. we are so finely aware of needing to manage "how we come off" to others that we don't often have space or time to tune-in with ourselves." â€” danielle 

    this insight wasn't exactly new to me but the way she said it: mind-blowing.

* things we touched on that i want to dig into:
    * [apology styles](http://www.5lovelanguages.com/profile/apology/) (and i want to find out what mine is)
    * [languages of appreciation](http://www.appreciationatwork.com/)
    * what are my actual love languages (i have guesses and people have told me what they think mine are, but i have never taken [the test](http://www.5lovelanguages.com/profile/))

    related thought: it might be nice (necessary? super advantageous?) to know things like that for new hires or partners in my work. this could be cool not only because it would be good info for me as an employer or colleague, but also because then those people would know those things about themselves forever more. maybe doing things like the emotional intelligence test would also be good intake... or maybe even just in the interview. those scores wouldn't be disqualifiers, but they'd definitely be factors. this could also help to shift who is seen as a good candidate (people in oppressor classes probably have lower emotional intelligence levels...)

in the end, the retreat was excellent for me as an individual. i learned so much and now have so many different fronts on which to grow. woot.
