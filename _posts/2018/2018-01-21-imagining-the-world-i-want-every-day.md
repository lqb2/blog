last weekend, at a dear friend's birthday party, a new connection, inspired me to commit to a daily practice. that lovely human is named donna harati and during one of the many, amazing conversations that weekend, she shared that she has committed to imagining the world she wants for 10 minutes a day. 

i was stunned. 

Here is the piece where Alicia Garza talks about doing visioning for ten minutes a Day (toward the end) http://www.complex.com/life/2017/11/black-lives-matter-founder-alicia-garza-talks-staying-centered-in-the-face-of-extreme-adversity

And the “hope as a discipline” idea is from Mariame Kaba (). 

she shared that she is inspired the idea of “hope as a discipline” from mariame kaba [@prisonculture](https://twitter.com/prisonculture) as well as [alicia garza](https://twitter.com/aliciagarza)'s commitment ["to purposefully envision solutions and freedom for ten minutes a day."](http://www.complex.com/life/2017/11/black-lives-matter-founder-alicia-garza-talks-staying-centered-in-the-face-of-extreme-adversity)

and then when i saw the words below in a piece from junot díaz, i was struck even more (even harder? idk). 

> "Radical hope is our best weapon against despair, even when despair seems justifiable; it makes the survival of the end of your world possible. Only radical hope could have imagined people like us into existence. And I believe that it will help us create a better, more loving future." - [Under President Trump, Radical Hope Is Our Best Weapon](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/21/under-president-trump-radical-hope-is-our-best-weapon)

anyways, i loved donna's idea and so i decided to also commit to that practice (caveat: i decided to commit to doing it for one minute a day because i know that works for me). i do bits of sci-fi/speculative/visionary stuff anyways, but this daily practice seems the most... important. i've been taught during my facilitation trainings that one of the most important things for a facilitator to do is make sure the group/individual knows what the goal looks like (at least roughly). because, if the group doesn't know what the goal is, how are you supposed to know as a facilitator whether or not you've done your job of helping the group to get there? 

so that thinking should also apply to my work towards a more just world, too. if i don't have a vision/visions of what the world would look like when justice is achieved, it's gonna be pretty damn hard to know if we're getting closer or farther away from that moment. 

i've only done it a few days so far (because building habits takes time), but i've had some pretty excellent visions so far. this is gonna be an excellent practice to have worked into my system. thank you, donna, for the inspiration!!!
