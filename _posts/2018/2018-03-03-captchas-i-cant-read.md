this is just a little post snippet and it's mostly a complaint. 

in the last few months, i've gotten an increasing number of captchas that are actually not possible to decipher. 

example:

> is character #4 an 'a' or a 'u'?

i understand the point of captcha and trying to prevent automated programs from doing things (signing up for accounts for example) that only actual humans are supposed to do. 

but if actual humans can't decipher what the captcha says... what's the point?

anyway, maybe i'll post more of these here as i find them.
