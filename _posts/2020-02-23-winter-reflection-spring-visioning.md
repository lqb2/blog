this weekend, dcc and i are having a self-guided retreat! we are pomodoroing, meditating, writing, eating, reflection, visioning. it's dope. 

yesterday, we reflected on how winter has been so far (we are about 2/3 through) and did some visioning of how we want spring to be. here are some distilled thoughts. i'm writing them publicly so i (and she) can help keep me accountable to them. 

## winter reflection (2 out of 3 full moons passed)

* i have done a better job of wintering than in some previous years
* i did the best job of wintering in nov (not winter) and dec
* [in my goal of learning from trees this winter]({{ site.baseurl }}2020/01/12/learning-from-trees-and-hummingbirds/), i realized that since feb i have wintered more like an evergreen than a deciduous
* of my [winter practices]({{ site.baseurl }}blog///2019/12/02/winter-practices/), the most consistent ones have been cuddling, waking up with the sun, both my sundown practices (telling folks my energy drops when the sun goes down and also not going anywhere other than home once the sun goes down)
* in the future, i want to hold firmer boundaries around my winter travel capacity
* the early parts of the spring semester (mid feb/ through early march) is the time of year where i do workshops and things in college classrooms. it's important to think that stuff through in advance so i don't stretch myself too thin
* after my travel slows down in early march, i want to lean back into slowing down. i'm trying to invest in the invisible work underground so that i have lots of creative energy to give in spring. i worry that too much activity in winter is a set up for spring burnout. 

## spring visioning

* i want to practice good boundaries with how much energy i'm giving to each of the projects i'm working on/in/with. as such...
* i want to copy abraham's system for mapping out all the projects happening and what level of involvement i have in each
* i want to launch lots of new beautiful projects *and* only be primary driver of a couple of them. that means refreshing and re-investing in my collaborative skills capacities

there's probably more but that's all i'm gonna write for now!
