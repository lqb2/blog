sometimes when i first hear something, it just floats by me. well, i guess it doesn't float "by," but it definitely doesn't stick out as important. i suppose it gets processed and internalized, but just remains idle. but then, when another thought that's relevant comes bombarding in, it lights up that other idea and makes it pop. i don't know if that happens to anyone else, but this post is a recent example of this occurrence.

[in pádraig's interivew](http://onbeing.org/programs/padraig-o-tuama-belonging-creates-and-undoes-us-both/), he mentioned how the idea of "here" totally depends on who you are (excerpt below). two people can be sitting in the same room and believe they are in two different places. this is possible because location is all about your point of reference. in my own life, i've seen movement people do this by acknowledging whose ancestral lands we're meeting on or which indigenous tribes still or used to call where we are land home. this is the idea that lodged itself without any active engagement at the time.

that idea didn’t stand out to me until carlo said [in his interview](http://www.onbeing.org/programs/carlo-rovelli-all-reality-is-interaction)) that “here” isn’t a meaningful idea in physics. everything exists in relationship. here is only identifiable as the relationship between two things. ex: latitude and longitude only makes sense based on their center points (the equator and the prime meridian, right?)

now, what does all of this mean for the world and social change? i'm not totally sure, but i have a few hunches. i know on at least some level i'm going to have to start, in all contexts, recognizing "where" i am based on who i'm giving credence. i should probably start with where i live (in jamaica plain) and where i work (at mit near the river). 

> And the complication for me was moving home to Ireland after those years away and suddenly being back in Ireland, being north of the border, and realizing that some places that I went, people would say, “Oh, you’re from Cork. We beat you in the hurling last weekend. You’re just a local, just 250 miles down the road. But you know, you’re just local.” And other people would say, “Oh, you’re from Ireland. What’s it like for you living in our country?” And you’re kind of going, “I think I’m in my own country. I can read the etymology of the land, of the place names. I feel at home here.”

> And so suddenly this question of, “What is home?” was really complicated. And here — you hear that way when people are speaking here, because Northern Ireland or the North of Ireland, though basically — they can be loaded terms. Sometimes you hear people saying, “Oh today’s a great day in this part of Ireland.” And other people say, “Today is a great day in this part of the United Kingdom.” So “here” is actually a complicated compromise. Also to be able to say, “What is happening right here, right now?” Even if it’s not what you’d choose. - pádraig ó tuama
