# what did i start

* tarot
* astrology
* the formation project
* first float session
* family tree work
* jp queer movie night

# what went well


* hit my goal of facilitating 100 meetings

# what did i learn? 

* i like working with students
* i like giving talks
* i like to work with groups i can facilitate with over multiple sessions (ptop, 4-week ps4sc)
* i still like coaching and it seems valuable to others still 
* i'm beginning to feel the value in bi-weekly and monthly things (continuing to develop grasp of things at lower frequency but high depth)
* how to teach mindfulness to k-12 humans
* i love babies. 3 were born this year in my life (asa, alvie, leah). 2 last year (abraham, apollo). jayden is 8.
* as i get older, annual rituals are way important. 
    - 4th of july in maine
    - 2nd family weekend in maine
    - lamb roast
    - sinterklaas
    - cider quest
    - halloween
* monthly rituals are also becoming important
    - roommate dinner + beginning anew
    - bullet journal setup + room clean
* serious writing only works for me in long chunks
* facilitation of a lot of things makes me learn a lot
    - i most often facilitate: organizational development, team-building, difficult conversations, identity (notably race, but not exclusively)

    

# what didn't go well

* failed one consulting contract <!-- oflc -->
* started but never got off the ground: wakanda tarot deck, audio storytelling platform with rajesh and david benjamin, SHIFTcities job, DUSP home groups
* never got started: organizing EL men, involvement in harvard sound education conference
* under prioritized connections with fraternity brothers



# relationship stuff 

* lots of opportunities for relationship but i'm mostly not making time for it right now. feels more important to focus on myself, my growth, my work, and my finances.
* traveled a lot and it was super fun and i've got to get better at the coming in and out of town. i used to have this down back in my florida days (age 19-21, right around my last 7-year transition) and now i need to learn what's gonna work at this age and this moment in my life. this is also a part of learning how to be more adaptive (maybe i'm a traveling mystic/shaman/sage?)

# quotes for the year

* “No tree, it is said, can grow to heaven unless its roots reach down to hell.”  ― Carl Jung
* "You don't have to do anything that feels wrong to grow." - Barbara carrellas
* "We are what we repeatedly do." - Will Durant, summarizing Aristotle 
* "Mysticism and revolution are two aspects of the same attempt to bring about radical change. Mystics cannot prevent themselves from becoming social critics, since in self-reflection they will discover the roots of a sick society. Similarly, revolutionaries cannot avoid facing their own human condition, since in the midst of their struggle for a new world they will find that they are also fighting their own reactionary fears and false ambitions." — Henri J.M. Nouwen
* “No tree, it is said, can grow to heaven unless its roots reach down to hell.” ― Carl Jung
* "You are moving at the correct pace." — danielle coates-connor

# what does all that mean for 2019?

* top level message: transformation. support it. 
* babies, especially when they're little, demand attention in ways that are unpredictable. in order to make time for the babies/kids in my life, i'm going to have to develop much more dynamic structures. "strong structures, loosely held." (a play on "strong beliefs, loosely held.")
* i want to focus on personal storytelling, pre- and post-patriarchy x time travel, reading and producing afrofuturist work (including black sci-fi), neighborhood community-building, men's work, and self-and-community development
    - say no to things that fall outside of those lanes
* move away from facilitating one-off engagements. move towards recurring or on-going engagements. this supports transformation. 
* move towards building on what works/gets results. move away from first-time experiments. 
* collaborate with more folks of color. 
* mentor more young folks of color.
* release no meeting day. seems not functional while working 1/2 time job and consulting outside of that.
* being more prepared for traveling. that means getting a set of stuff that's pretty much just for traveling. (s/o to annemarie for taking my thinking one layer farther by suggesting i actually just have 1-2 sets of clothes that stay in my suitcase so that i don't have to think about what's in there when i pack). i expect this to reduce my travel headaches (forgetting things, taking forever to pack) by one million percent.
