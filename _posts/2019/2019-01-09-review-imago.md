**What are the main ideas?**
the main idea of this book is that all life follows similar cycles: (1) it is begun/planed with the best intentions from its progenitors, (2) it must go through its own (probably arduous, brutal) process to acclimate to its surroundings if it is going to survive, (3) in the process of that acclimation, it will modify those surroundings to make survival possible, and (4) it begins the cycle again, hoping that its offsring learn and have a better life than it did. 

**If I implemented one idea from this book right now, which one would it be?**
remember that the process of acclimation to ones surroundings isn't part of life... it _is_ life. 

**How would I describe the book to a friend?**
a mind-blowing ending to a trilogy about the complexity of adjusting to life in new contexts. also aliens.
