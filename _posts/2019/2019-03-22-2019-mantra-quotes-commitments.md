this post might take two days to put together, but it's going to be an important one. it'll be a combination post of the two posts i visited most often last year: [my 2018 mantra post]({{ site.baseurl }}2018/01/07/be-a-conduit-and-other-2018-phrases/) and my [2018 list of commitments]({{ site.baseurl }}2018/01/11/commitments-for-2018/). it's informed by my [latest annual reflection retreat]({{ site.baseurl }}2019/03/15/annual-reflection-review/) (sidenote: a great thing about making my thinking public is that whenever or wherever i want to look at something i know i've published here, i can just pull up a browser on anyone's phone or computer and go find them on my blog). 

so here goes:

## mantra for 2019

> _we are what we repeatedly do._ — [will durant, summarizing aristotle](http://blogs.umb.edu/quoteunquote/2012/05/08/its-a-much-more-effective-quotation-to-attribute-it-to-aristotle-rather-than-to-will-durant/)


it is becoming clearer and clearer to me that the most important learning edge i have is to learn how to do less. i have gotten to place i have in my life by my capacity to do a lot. it has been great. **and** it is no longer a way of being that serving me, my work, or my life well. and so! i will commit to learning how to do less, all while knowing that i have the capacity to do so much more. 

## other quotes for 2019

* _Mysticism and revolution are two aspects of the same attempt to bring about radical change. Mystics cannot prevent themselves from becoming social critics, since in self-reflection they will discover the roots of a sick society. Similarly, revolutionaries cannot avoid facing their own human condition, since in the midst of their struggle for a new world they will find that they are also fighting their own reactionary fears and false ambitions._ —Henri J.M. Nouwen
* _"you don't have to do anything that feels wrong to grow."_ - barbara carrellas
* _"don't just do something, sit there."_ — sylvia boorstein
* _"no tree, it is said, can grow to heaven unless its roots reach down to hell.”_ ― carl jung
* _"you are moving at the correct pace."_ - danielle coates-connor 
* _"you are the magic. the words are just the tupperware."_ - samantha tan
* _"show me your budget and your calendar and i’ll show you your priorities."_ malia lazu

## 2019 commitments

many of these are borrowing from 2018 but with some shifts. some of them are new. 

2019 commitments

* one no meeting day per week (it’s looking like mondays)
* email
    * do not read new emails before 11a
    * communicate my email policy() to all collaborators and clients
    * draft emails the night before to send in the morning
    * design system of admin support for processing my email
* schedule 2 tech sabbaths per month (sundown friday to sundown sat). enter the sabbath by participating in shabbat prayers with friends. ideally, schedule the two sabbaths at the beginning of the month. 
* on the first saturday of every month:
    * spend 15 minutes cleaning room
    * pay outstanding bills
    * set up the new month in my bullet journal
* collaborate with more people of color on side projects. 
* begin practice of seasonal scheduling "coffee meetings." 
* meditate: 20 mins/day + 1h session/week (the 1h session can replace one of the 20 minute days). 
* never answer “how are you” shallowly. i can either (a) answer for real, (b) politely, explicitly abstain from answering, or (c) offer to answer a different, more specific question (how’s my day? how am i right now?)
* avoid working lunches at all costs. when in doubt, fast.
* plan to end all meetings at :20 or :50. this is a practice i’m borrowing from many places, but most directly from my therapist and lawyers.
* feel all my feelings, especially anger. 
* became a master of my finances.

hm! i should probably sort this list at some point... someday! #doneisbetterthanperfect

sadly, i can't find a way to embed the full length gif, but the <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/BkL4Vyz0z2iYQMhwFw/source.mp4">full version is over here on GIPHY</a>. and still, even this abbreviated one is magic.
