And then the front door opened and the boy's father walked in. 

"Tomorrow's the day, ya?" he tossed into the room, air now electric. 

We both stood, braced for impact. 

Not wanting to wait too long, I wanted to make the proposal. First mover advantage, right? 

"Hello, Noh. It's good to see you."

As we relaxed into the Link, our minds melded with the house. Skin tingling, eyes fluttering closed, heart beats slowing, breath deepening. Our intentions formed into color, pace, movement, sound, all directly piped into each other's consciousness. 

And then, the house made its intentions clear.

"I watch this happen every generation and yet you all still haven't learned: the imagination of the children is always ahead. You must give them handrails, but let them lead. They will fall until they can walk. And when they are ready to walk, we all will be the better for it. Let him feel. He'll know what to do..."
