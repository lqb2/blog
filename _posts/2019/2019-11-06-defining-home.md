for the past many months, i've rediscovered my joy of defining words for myself. i used to do this to learn words back in like... elementary school, but i mostly haven't done it since then. now i find that almost every conversation has me feeling like i want to redefine everything! anyway...

in my definition home is any place where i:

* feel belonging, and
* know how i uniquely contribute

this has evolved from the definition of home that i grew up with and really held through college: there is only place you can call home and if it's not the place you grew up, it must be because something went wrong or is wrong with that place. the older i get, the more places i feel at/are home. i also find i'm getting clearer about what **isn't** home, including the places other people might expect me to call home but i don't. 

anywho, here's to keeping this post short and sweet!
