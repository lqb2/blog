<p class="message">it's feb! that means it's black history/futures month. my goal is one flash fiction story every day. all stories from the month <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}tags/#black%20history/futures%20month-ref">here</a>.</p>

most of the time i couldn't help it. if my head got too cloudy, it just felt natural to mudra with my free hand. mostly chin mudra (because it was my thinking that was blocked) but sometimes i would use prithvi mudra if i felt myself too far out of my body. everyone once in a while, i might pull out prana mudra, but those moments were pretty rare. prana mudra was for activating dormant energy in my body and i almost never had a problem with summoning enough energy to do whatever task was in front of me. 

occasionally i would get stuck, though. particularly in moments where i wasn't getting enough sleep. or when i was simply trying to do too much at once and then, instead of doing at least one thing, i would find myself doing nothing. 

those moments were the hardest and, of course, that's when prana mudra came in handy... get it? handy! ha!

anyway, like i was saying before, most of the time i couldn't help it. which made it easy... or hard, depending on how you look at it, to get stared at often. on the train, in my classroom, at my work desk, on the farm, pretty much everywhere. it was awkward, for sure, but i couldn't help. if i didn't use mudras to corral my energy, i could spend minutes, even hours, stuck on a task, blocking my own way. 

and i'd found that the stares were much, much better than impeding my own progress. i had too much work to do here to slow myself down. there were another other forces working on that for me to make it any easier for them.
