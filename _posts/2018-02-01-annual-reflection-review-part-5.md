## day 4

* set up calendly for 2018 (still haven't actually finished this and it's causing me a huge block in scheduling meetings =[)
* update list of tools tried in 2017
* started drafting a new github website and adding appropriate sections to it
* finish mapping out the conferences i want to go to
* start a new file management system on my computer with the hope of no longer keeping files on my desktop. [[method](http://www.asianefficiency.com/organization/organizing-files-folders-documents/)]

so... where am i... lol i've been writing this post for so many days i can't even remember where i was going with this reflection...

well, actually, i guess something i did last year was reflect on what i liked about this round and what i wish/want to do differently in the future. 

**i liked...** 
* taking four days. it was a lot of time and i didn't feel rushed.
* opening up the last two days to hold space for a group.


**i wish...**
* i still had more time (i think). probably gonna take the whole first week next year. that might be my cap. 
* i prioritized the things i wanted to accomplish better. not getting my automated scheduling system totally in place is already causing havoc. 
* i had been able to hold that physical collective space on days 3 and 4.

ok. maybe that's all i've got for reflecting right now. time to move on and start living into these systems, ya know?
