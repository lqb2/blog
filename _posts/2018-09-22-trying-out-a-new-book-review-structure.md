i recently read a post from james clear about [how to remember more from the books i read](https://jamesclear.com/reading-comprehension-strategies?__s=psunfhcwjysucnxhm1xq). 

he gives seven tips:

1. quit more books
2. choose books you can use instantly
3. create searchable notes
4. combine knowledge trees
5. write a short summary
6. surround the topic
7. read it twice

all the tips are great but number five, "write a short summary", is what i'm thinking about implementing here. james says to write a three sentence summary and consider these questions:

* What are the main ideas?
* If I implemented one idea from this book right now, which one would it be?
* How would I describe the book to a friend?

so, i'll try this for the rest of the year and see how it goes! starting today (with a review writeup of adulthood rites by octavia butler).
