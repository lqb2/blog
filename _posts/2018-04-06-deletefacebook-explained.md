ok, story over. real talk: i think we're (finally) watching the end of facebook. and by "think" i really mean "hope." 

i hope that the collapse of facebook is coming and that it will just take some time. it's beginning and happening in waves. about two years ago, a string of friends, often the most spiritually contemplative or internally reflective people in my life, quit facebook. they're currently the ones who i am constantly repeating this story with: 

**me**: oh yea, and game day last week was awesome.  
**them**: i didn't know about it.  
**me**: shoot. i forgot that i only send out that invite via facebook...  

now with the cambridge analytica shenanigans, i'm feeling the hive buzz again. we can only be poked so many times before swarming. 

two other recent stories give me hope that facebook is dying, both stories from friends of mine who teach teenagers.

1. "my students aren't even on facebook. they're using instagram, snapchat, anything other than facebook." 
1. "one time one of my students said to me 'facebook? ha. facebook is where old people go to get their news." 

that last one slayed me because... that's totally right. I'M NOT A YOUNG PERSON ANYMORE. :O *existential crises over*

anyway, i think the exodus is beginning/continuing. i plan to be on this wave, for sure. i set my deadline as 1 jan 2019, but i'm feeling like i'll probably do it early. it's just not worth it. not only is the bad outweighing on the good on a societal level, it also results in much secondhand trauma (triggering news stories) and wasted time (scrolling). i stopped scrolling on there a while ago, but it just seems so much more bad than good these days. 

also things like this: [on twitter, fake news travels faster than true stories](http://news.mit.edu/2018/study-twitter-false-news-travels-faster-true-stories-0308).

ps - if they're aware that they're dying (which they probably are since they can see everything we do and think there), i wonder what they're doing to either (a) try and stop it or (b) be ready for it by investing energy in other things...
