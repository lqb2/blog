[Captive Genders: Trans Embodiment and the Prison Industrial Complex by Eric A. Stanley, Nat Smith](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9954047-captive-genders#){:target="_blank"}

<b>What are the main ideas?</b> 
* prisons are a fundamental element of the (constructed and false) gender binary.
* prisons cannot meaningfully be made more inclusive for trans and non-binary people because the institution of prison is a key purveyor of the violence of Western concepts of gender. 
* in order to advance prison abolition, collaboration between people inside (especially BIPOC trans people) and people outside of prions is necessary. 
* it is possible to advocate for reforms that aim for inclusion of trans people in dominant power systems. this is short-sighted and ultimately helps to strengthen the prison industrial complex (PIC). 



<b>If I implemented one idea from this book right now, which one would it be?</b>

watch out for pitfalls in doing abolitionist work that have the unintended consequence of strengthening or expanding the PIC. for example: advocating for trans-inclusive prison facilities might lead to the building of a new facility rather than keeping people safe while the existing prisons are made obsolete.

<b>How would I describe the book to a friend?</b>

you know, honestly, this book was deeply overwhelming. and not just because the content is intense. i haven't read an academic anthology like this since college/grad school and now i very much know why. as my friend nadav said "i don't even remember half of it." the mixture of personal essays felt forced between the academic pieces. i was really confused about the ratio of theory to lived experience. i also felt yanked around by the pace at which personal experiences were pulled into high-level conceptual theory (too fast). some of the pieces felt really powerful and i learned a lot from them (like the maroon abolitionists chapter). grateful for those. i probably could have learned as much if this were 1/3 of the length. it sort of felt at times like it was a "we gotta include everyone here" and that weakened the overall structure. i wonder what the first, non-extended edition read like... maybe it was tighter.
