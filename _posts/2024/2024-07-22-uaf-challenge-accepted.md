<p class="message">hi seth. your turn! :)</p>


"ugh, babe! what the fuck!" 

"what?"

"in the last five minutes, i just watched our drive time triple." 

"i mean... isn't that a good thing?" 

"how in the WORLD could that be a good thing?"

"i dunno. i thought you were all into people being more in tune with the planet and planets and stars and stuff." 

"well, sure, i want that. but i want them to come by it honestly."

"woah, woah woah... what does _that_ mean?"

"i mean i want them to figure it out by doing their own work and research and making connections for themselves."

"oh, so collective systems are good in some cases and not in others, ya?"

"ya!"

the couple was on their drive north to get a good position for the northern lights total solar eclipse combo. it was 415a and they had left at 2a. they were excited to be making good time by leaving early. they hoped to be to their destination, south carolina, by 7a and now it looked like they might not get there until early evening. which was a problem because the eclipse was in the early afternoon. 

as floridians, they had a love/hate relationship with the northern lights being visible farther and farther south as the climate changed. having beautiful planetary experiences closer to home was lovely; but they hated the increased popularity of viewing these moments since the national alert system got upgraded to include solar flares, the northern lights, and eclipses. 

"so what do we do, cutie?"

"idk. does your friend in atlanta still have access to their private helicopter and jet?"

"you want to burn fossil fuel to go see the northern lights...?"
