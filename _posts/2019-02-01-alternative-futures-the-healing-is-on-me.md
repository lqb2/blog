<p class="message">it's feb! that means it's black history/futures month. time to get writing! goal is one flash fiction story every day. let's see how it goes...</p>

i finally figured out what it was going to take. 

my whole life i had grown up at the bottom of the family tree. before breakfast and after dinner, we'd go out to the tree and put ourselves in it. mom and dad right below all 8 grandparents and then me and my brother right below them. but when my brother stopped joining us, i became the lowest on the tree. 

and then, last month when my teacher told me it's the responsbility of the lowest on the tree to do the healing of the lineage, i realized it was going to take me doing my own work to learn how to do the rest of the work. 

ugh.
