this winter, i am learning from the wisdom of trees and hummingbirds. as i continue to deepen my practice of putting my life back in tune with the planet, i am watching and learning from these two life forms and seeing what i can learn. below is what i've learned and am now practicing.

## trees

observation: (reminded of this by [dcc](http://infinitegrowth.rocks/about)) after dropping all their leaves, trees shift energy to their roots. sap, the literal life force of trees, moves from the branches down to the roots. that's where the work is in the winter; underground, hidden, dark, deep in the earth. 

* practice: do as little outward-facing work as possible. 
* practice: root at home as much as possible. 
* practice: connect with people i already know; limit connection with people i do not yet know (no matter how cool they are). request that new connections happen after winter ends and schedule accordingly.

## hummingbirds

observation: many birds fly south for the winter. hummingbirds do it in the extreme. in the fall, many hummingbirds feed heavily on one of nature's sweetest foods, nectar, and then fly thousands of miles to warmer climates for the winter.

* practice: if i must travel, travel to warm places. 
* practice: remember that the sweetest nourishment can sustain me for incredibly long journeys. get it when it's accessible and then don't waste it.

will add to this as i learn over the season (which ends on march 19, 2020).
