[Care Work: Dreaming Disability Justice](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38402046-care-work){:target="_blank"}

**What are the main ideas?** 

* healing and curing are not the same thing. cures are not always possible; hell, they are not even always desired
* ableism encourages (maybe even creates) the patterns of burnout that exist in our movements. 
* centering the lives and leadership of sick and disabled queer, trans, Black, and brown people has the potential to create movements that will create justice for all peoples
* "if our movements are not healing, there's no point to them." â€” cara page
* framing care and access as collective efforts, instead of as individual ones, is how we can escape the binarism of "self" vs "community" care/access.


**If I implemented one idea from this book right now, which one would it be?**

notice all the ways ableism shows up in my personal and organization spaces. notice and acknowledge these out loud. learn to intervene in them.

**How would I describe the book to a friend?**

a wide-ranging set of intellectual essays uncovering the precious gems of insight generated from years of praxis. there is no question that the personal is the political here.
