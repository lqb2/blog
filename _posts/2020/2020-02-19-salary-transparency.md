edit: 19 feb 2020 - to date, this research (and a little nudging from me or friends i have armed with this research) has supported 5 jobs that were listed without a salary to be reposted with an explicit salary range. it's small but it's something!

edit: 2 feb 2022 — 8+ jobs now have posted their salary ranges as a result of these resources. slow and steady wins the race i hear...

update: 2 oct 2022 - added more articles.
