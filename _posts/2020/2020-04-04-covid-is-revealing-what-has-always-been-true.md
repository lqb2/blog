something i have taken to saying often since the covid pandemic has hit is "everything has changed and nothing has changed." what i mean by this is that, yes, this global pandemic is a new thing. and everything it is revealing has always been true. some examples:

## linear time is a construction 

ways i hear other people speaking to this truth:

* feelings change moment to moment and rapidly. how i was an hour ago might be totally different than how i am now. 
* a couple days feels like a week, a week feels like a month, a month feels like an eternity ("we are in shutdown through APRIL?!")

## the future is uncertain

* "i don't know how to plan for anything right now! who knows when this will end?"
* "i'm not sure i can commit to [insert opportunity]. i have no idea how i'm going to be by [insert date in the future].

## we are all connected

* "damn. covid seems to know no boundaries of geography or identity."

## capitalism isn't working

* "it's wild that companies, even big ones, are flocking to crowdfunding platforms to ask the public to support their employees."
* the CARES Act

there is SO much more to write here but my ten mins is up so i'm gonna keep it moving to my next post. 

my intention my writing this post isn't to be callous, though i can imagine this coming off that way. my reason for writing this is to just say that though this global pandemic is new, the shit that's coming up is not. and i think that what that means is that how we handle this moment and reconfigure our lives both now and in the future will determine how many of those fundamental truths we truly embed into the constructions of our world(s).
