i realized yesterday that i hadn't written much about my [annual reflection process]({{ site.baseurl }}tags/#annual reflection-ref). i wrote one post but it's more notes for me than anything. it's time to say some more, especially since that maureen and i are planning an annual retreat called 2020vision for next year (more info coming soon on that so email me if you're interested).

i don't know if i'll end up writing five posts about it like i did [last year]({{ site.baseurl }}2018/01/23/annual-reflection-review-part-1/), but right now i'm feeling the desire to break my thoughts up into **process** and **content**. i think for now i'll just "bullet" things and maybe do more narrative weaving later. 

## process

* this year, it worked out for me to rent a friend's apartment while he was traveling. ideally, i would have gone away from the city but this situation was just working out too well. my dream is to go away to a beautiful, quiet, natural place for my annual reflection retreat _and_ the minimum requirement is that i just not be at home. i need to be in a different space so that i don't/can't get distracted by little things that break up my spaciousness (like chores i've put off for a long time and now that i have four days, decide to do and eat up hours of my reflecting time). it's just a bonus if the space is beautiful and natural. 

* around october 2018, i picked my retreat dates. that's the point at which i had enough clarity about what my january was going to look like to feel good about choosing dates. 

* i started building a list of things to do in my phone/computer apple notes app basically as soon as i finished my retreat (january 2018 when i reflected on 2017). as i thought of or saw ideas for activities to do on retreat that would be helpful to my reflecting and planning, i added them to the notes file. i knew that this would create more things to do than i could ever have time for, but i wanted to have a full menu of things to chose from. 

* the week before my retreat, i started to narrow down what things i felt **needed** to get done on retreat, what things would be **nice** to do, and what things just probably wouldn't happen.

* i packed up the day before just as if i was going on a trip. full suitcase and everything. i committed to not going home because that felt important to hold the container for myself. 

## content

* i had a MASSIVE list of activities to choose from. i knew it couldn't possibly finish it all, but that wasn't the point. at the time of the retreat, i didn't have them categorized but in hindsight, i think the categories (each of which may have had 1-15 specific tasks) were:
    * review time spent
    * review money spent
    * review my systems, tools, and frameworks (bullet journal, calendar systems, friend zones, etc)
    * cleaning and maintenance of said systems
    * plan for personal and professional development
    * plan for community engagement 
    * build my shadow calendar (which includes making phone calls to my zone 1 folks)
    * ideate and launch projects i have been blocked on
    * update protocols and practices based on everything implemented so far

**what i actually did**

so based on all the categories above and subtasks under each, here's a rundown of what i actually did. "did" in this context includes things i completed as well as tasks i started and didn't complete. i include time estimates because i think it's helpful info. but note they are actually estimates. 

* reviewing
    * review time spent
        * my (at this point) standard calendar review process ([see "part 1: review and reflect" of this post](2016/12/23/my-personal-retreat-long-version/)) (8h)
    * review money spent (3h)
    * review systems, tools, and functional life frameworks (2h)

* reflecting
    * reflect on vision and values statement (where am i living into it? where am i not yet?) (2h + all over the place)
