i realized yesterday that i hadn't written much about my [annual reflection process]({{ site.baseurl }}tags/#annual reflection-ref). i wrote one post but it's more notes for me than anything. it's time to say some more, especially since that maureen and i are planning an annual retreat called 2020vision for next year (more info coming soon on that so email me if you're interested).

i don't know if i'll end up writing five posts about it like i did [last year]({{ site.baseurl }}2018/01/23/annual-reflection-review-part-1/), but right now i'm feeling the desire to break my thoughts up into **process** and **content**. i think for now i'll just "bullet" things and maybe do more narrative weaving later. 

## process

* this year, it worked out for me to rent a friend's apartment while he was traveling. ideally, i would have gone away from the city but this situation was just working out too well. my dream is to go away to a beautiful, quiet, natural place for my annual reflection retreat _and_ the minimum requirement is that i just not be at home. i need to be in a different space so that i don't/can't get distracted by little things that break up my spaciousness (like chores i've put off for a long time and now that i have four days, decide to do and eat up hours of my reflecting time). it's just a bonus if the space is beautiful and natural. 

* around october 2018, i picked my retreat dates. that's the point at which i had enough clarity about what my january was going to look like to feel good about choosing dates. 

* i started building a list of things to do in my phone/computer apple notes app basically as soon as i finished my retreat (january 2018 when i reflected on 2017). as i thought of or saw ideas for activities to do on retreat that would be helpful to my reflecting and planning, i added them to the notes file. i knew that this would create more things to do than i could ever have time for, but i wanted to have a full menu of things to chose from. 

* the week before my retreat, i started to narrow down what things i felt **needed** to get done on retreat, what things would be **nice** to do, and what things just probably wouldn't happen.

*---[end writing 15 march]---*

*---[begin writing 16 march]---*

* i packed up the day before just as if i was going on a trip. full suitcase and everything. i committed to not going home because that felt important to hold the container for myself. 

## content

* i had a MASSIVE list of activities to choose from. i knew it couldn't possibly finish it all, but that wasn't the point. at the time of the retreat, i didn't have them categorized but in hindsight, i think the categories (each of which may have had 1-15 specific tasks) were:
    * review time spent
    * review money spent
    * review my systems, tools, and frameworks (bullet journal, calendar systems, friend zones, etc)
    * cleaning and maintenance of said systems
    * plan for personal and professional development
    * plan for community engagement 
    * build my shadow calendar (which includes making phone calls to my zone 1 folks)
    * ideate and launch projects i have been blocked on
    * update protocols and practices based on everything implemented so far

*---[end writing mar 16]---*

*---[begin writing mar 17]---*

**what i actually did**

so based on all the categories above and subtasks under each, here's a rundown of what i actually did. "did" in this context includes things i completed as well as tasks i started and didn't complete. i include time estimates because i think it's helpful info. but note they are actually estimates. 

* reviewing
    * review time spent
        * my (at this point) standard calendar review process ([see "part 1: review and reflect" of this post](2016/12/23/my-personal-retreat-long-version/)) (8h)
    * review money spent (3h)
    * review systems, tools, and functional life frameworks (2h)

* reflecting
    * reflect on vision and values statement (where am i living into it? where am i not yet?) (2h + all over the place)

* planning
    * bullet journal (3h)
    * update [friend zones](https://medium.com/@lqb2/planning-out-my-friend-ecosystem-95175246458d) (2h)
    * create new [shadow calendar](https://medium.com/@lqb2/my-shadow-calendar-an-experiment-in-aligning-my-time-with-my-values-d31219621288) (4h)
    * plan for community engagement (6h)
        * ideate and launch new or previously blocked projects 
    * personal and professional development (3h)
        * scheduling two book editing weeks
        * scoping meditation retreats and other retreats
        * researching trainings
    * update protocols and practices (1h)
    * budget (1h)

*---[end march 17 writing]---*

*---[begin march 21 writing]---*

and some just some reflections on the process as a whole this year. 

### i like...

* the amount of money i spent on housing for the retreat. the ratio of getting what i needed to what i spent felt great.
* how many community engaging things i took some steps towards making happened. the list is actually quite epic:
    * menâ€™s circle (bell hooks six elements of love?) (lead)
    * moon circles (lead)
    * 1:1s w/ one teacher (participant)
    * post-patriarchy futures (co-lead)
    * big talk x msg (co-lead)
    * queer movie night (co-lead)
    * dusp ptop #2 (potential facilitator)
* the insights i gain from spending an entire day thinking about how i used my time in 

### i wish...

* i had put more time and energy into my budgeting processes. 
* i had put more time into nailing down my shadow calendar. 
* i hadn't launched so many projects! i think i am too good at that.
* i had spent more time reflecting on the tools and systems i use. 
* i spent more time reviewing the goals i set in my august 2018 retreat and setting new goals for 2019.


### therefore, next year...

* i need to do more prep work for my budgets before retreat or i need to make more time and space for that chunk.
* i would like start reflecting with my woes in december so that when we talk in january, we can nail things down for my shadow calendar during my retreat week. i would also like set a specific day that i'll call them so i can make sure we all connect and i can finish the whole thing. 
* i will find way to narrow down the projects i will launch. maybe i'll plan to do half of what's in the potential set of ideas or something...
* i will spend more time review my tool stack, fixing it up, and getting rid of tools i no longer need.
* i will make setting goals a more explicit part of the process. and i mean identity based goals ([like james clear talks about](https://jamesclear.com/identity-based-habits)), not outcome-based goals. the outcomes follow from the identity shifts.

phew! i guess i did end up writing ~4/5 posts about my retreat (just like last year, lol). this time i just kept adding to the same post instead of starting a new one each day. 

anywho, given that this is the fourth, it means the next one i write will be the one that is parallel to my ["be a conduit" (and other phrases/mantras for 2018)]({{ site.baseurl }}2018/01/07/be-a-conduit-and-other-2018-phrases/) post. coming right up...
