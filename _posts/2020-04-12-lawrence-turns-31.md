you know, just celebrating my birthday in the time of a global pandemic. but, as always, in every challenge is an opportunity:

* **i am grieving**: hugs, in person, sweaty dancing 
* **i am gaining**: a space for my friends from all over the country to meet each other with minimal carbon impact, simultaneous solo dancing all over turtle island, an opportunity to take a luxurious bath while still connecting with my friends (actually, i did that last year too LOL)

## birthday video office hours

inspired by matt taylor. drop in anytime, including just for literally one minute to say hi and then bye. also, i reserve the right to be in a bathtub (inspired by eroc and also matt):

* thursday, 16 april 2020, 4-7p EDT, or
* saturday, 18 april 2020, 5-6p EDT

## wish list

[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G2ve18VOrN9B5QAdpzY4h-_c0qco_VJDhOMJCypZP3s/edit#gid=0). has some gifts for me and some places to donate money, too. because sharing is caring.
