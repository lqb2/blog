during the 14-19 july 2025 better selves fellowship week, i had the great joy of receiving the phrase "take, tweak, trash" from [ramon de jesus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ramon-de-jesus-7bb37418/){:target='_blank'}! 

i'm writing this here to make sure i remember where i got that phrase from and to acknowledge that i have **already** incorporated this into my coaching practice and will continue to do so. i use it when i offer a request or challenge and it replaced the phrase "accept, modify, or reject."

thanks, ramon!
