the other day, i was on a call and one of the folks on the call told us this lovely story. i'm paraphrasing, but you'll get the picture. 

the other day, i was sitting some friends and their three young children. the topic of conversation was a family friend who was going to have a baby soon. the first kid said, "wow! they could have a baby girl." the second kid said, "yes! they could also have a baby boy." the third kid said, "they could also have a baby they!" 

as cameron reminded me this morning: "the babies know."
