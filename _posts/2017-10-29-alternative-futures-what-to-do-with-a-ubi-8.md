*tyne's journal cont'd* 

either way, in the end, the decision was that everyone had to take the ubi because that was the only way to systematically determine if it worked. it was a drop in the bucket for me, but still appreciated it. 

what the major places began to see, though, was a divide in how people used their ubis. folks with high earning potential just added it into their regular income and continued life as normal. folks who were able to finally live with their ubi actually started pooling the money and acting collectively. of course, because of the way the ubi card worked, it wasn't literally possible to put the money into a single fund or account, but humans are amazingly creative creatures. people strategized together and bought different parts of things and then shared them. several groups bought farms in upstate new york as water in western part of the country became scarce. other folks bought homes and renovated them to operate essentially like communes (i totally thought that idea would have died, but it seems some people are still keeping hope alive). 

collective purchasing, though surprising, wasn't totally unexpected. 

the part that was unexpected was the political moves. so far it's only happened in massachusetts, but other states are beginning to follow suit. 

the folks who now had their basic needs met via collective assets used their continued ubis to begin intervening in the political system. and in massachusetts, groups had been so effective as to have taken over two of the three branches of government. they had been so effective that they installed folks from their political base to both head positions for the judicial and legislative branch. 

and they are poised to do the same for the executive branch. 

that is... if i fail.
