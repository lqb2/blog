this post might take two days to put together, but it's going to be an important one. it'll be a combination post of the two posts i visited myself most often last year. my 2018 mantra post() and my 2018 list of commitments (). (sidenote: a great thing about making my thinking public is that whenever or wherever i want to look at something, i can just pull up a browser on anyone's phone or computer and go find them on my blog). 

so here goes:

## mantra for 2010

> don't just do something, sit there. — sylvia boorstein

it is becoming clearer and clearer to me that the most important learning edge i have is to learn how to do less. i have gotten to place i have in my life by my capacity to do a lot. it has been great. **and** it is no longer a way of being that serving me, my work, or my life well. and so! i will commit to learning how to do less, all while knowing that i have the capacity to do so much more. 

## other quotes for 2019

* Mysticism and revolution are two aspects of the same attempt to bring about radical change. Mystics cannot prevent themselves from becoming social critics, since in self-reflection they will discover the roots of a sick society. Similarly, revolutionaries cannot avoid facing their own human condition, since in the midst of their struggle for a new world they will find that they are also fighting their own reactionary fears and false ambitions. —Henri J.M. Nouwen
* "you don't have to do anything that feels wrong to grow." - barbara carrellas
* "we are what we repeatedly do." — will durant, summarizing aristotle 
* "no tree, it is said, can grow to heaven unless its roots reach down to hell.” ― carl jung
* "you are moving at the correct pace." - danielle coates-connor 
* "you are the magic. the words are just the tupperware." - samantha tan
* "show me your budget and your calendar and i’ll show you your priorities." malia lazu

## 2019 commitments

many of these are borrowing from 2018 but with some shifts. some of them are new.

sadly, i can't find a way to embed the full length gif, but the <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/BkL4Vyz0z2iYQMhwFw/source.mp4">full version is over here on GIPHY</a>. and still, even this abbreviated one is magic.
