for four weeks, i will be offering a 30-minute meditation call on wednesday mornings, 9-930a ET. we will gather on zoom each week and use one of the 4 elements as an anchor for our attention. we will intend to learn from the element for that week and yet be open to anything and everything that arises. 

the weekly arc:

* june 17 - fire
* june 24 - water
* july 1 - air
* july 8 - earth

each week, please bring an object on which you can anchor your attention. you are welcome to use whatever you like but here are a few simple suggestions: fire -> candle, water -> bowl or clear glass of water, air -> feather, earth -> a stone.

if you are interested, please fill out [this quick form](https://forms.gle/qcG8GyHpwhGnS14Q7) and be ready to hop on.
