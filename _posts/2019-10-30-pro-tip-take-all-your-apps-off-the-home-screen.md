team. this is HOT off the presses. yesterday, [maureen](https://www.maureenwhiteconsulting.com) and i were working on [2020 vision](https://2020vision.space) and she showed me the best hack since i learned [how to turn my screen to black and white](: you can take all the apps off your home screen.

_note: the above is almost what my phone screen looks like. you can't actually take screenshots in black and white so just trust that what i see is actually in grayscale, not color._

maureen is one of the most proficient minimalists i know. i even paid her to help me tidy ([konmari style](https://konmari.com)) my room. the fact that she figured this out on the phone doesn't surprise me. but this tip is already changing my life. 

i just did it last night and already i counted ten times where i unlocked my phone... and then just closed it.

what freedom. 

thanks, maureen. 

and you're welcome, world.
