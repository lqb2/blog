**What are the main ideas?** 

* gang violence is intergenerational, rooted in suppression of feelings (patriarchy), and exists at the intersection of protection and revenge
* trauma healing as a way to deal with ghosts is super important


**If I implemented one idea from this book right now, which one would it be?**

i would implement a new set of rules that counteract "the rules" from the book. the book's rules: "number one, no crying, number two, no snitching, and number three, always seek revenge." the rules i would implement: number one, cry often, number two, overcommunicate, and number three, seek transformative justice. 

**How would I describe the book to a friend?**

poetic fiction that illuminates that deep intricacies of gang violence and intergenerational trauma. this is a devastating and quick read that sticks to your bones. this book is a non-linear journey through one young person's experience with gun violence that has forever changed my thinking about guns, trauma, family, community, and the need for individual and collective healing.
