_inspiration: dave jenkins' ancestor story circle_

it was an entire year before i noticed what all was happening. 

i had been going out to the family tree every day. after i realized that the tree wasn't just a metapor but a literal pathway to my ancestory, i started exploring it as much as possible. of course i still had to work and do chores and handle other (flesh) family obligations, but all i wanted to do was explore our lineage. 

i found that each time i sat at the root of the tree and interwove with it, i was able to reach back just a little farther, or wider, in time. each rung backwards brought more people at an exponential scale. 2 parents, 4 grandparents, 8 greats, 16 great-greats and on and on. but getting to know each person still took the same amount of time. the journeying slowed but it was just as exciting day after day. 

a year into my exploration, i started noticing that i was able to work my downward certain branches. certain people's lineages that were horizontally (but not vertically) connected to mine felt possible to climb down. i only dabbled in this downwards traverse occasionally because there was so much above me that i wanted to know!

but today i took a leap and ran all the way down one of these branches... and realized the person at the bottom of the tree was _alive_! and she was sitting at the base of a tree in her parent's backyard...
