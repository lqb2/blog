what are the best things to do in boston with kids?!

i sometimes get asked this question when friends visit boston and so i'm writing up my list of top ideas:


# top 3

* the museum of science 
* the aquarium (a little pricey but the touch tank (with sting rays and tiny sharks) alone is probably worth it)
	- if you can time it right to catch a movie in the omni theatre, do it. sometimes even the not scary movies there are too scary for little kids because they're big and loud but if your kid can hang in regular movie theatres, this theatre is epic)
* the children's museum

# others

* Harvard Museums of Science & Culture | 26 Oxford Street, Cambridge, MA 02138
* riding all the trains
* allendale farms
* visiting the top of the prudential
* 

will probably keep adding to this list over time...
