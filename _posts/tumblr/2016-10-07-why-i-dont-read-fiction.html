<p>earlier this week i was talking with my friend spencer and he suggested a pair of books to add to my reading list. i said that i likely wouldn&rsquo;t read them. he asked why. i responded &lsquo;because they&rsquo;re fiction.&rsquo; he said we should talk about it later, but that he disagreed.Â <br/></p><p>he and i will probably talk about it later, but the reason i don&rsquo;t read fiction is because i genuinely feel like i don&rsquo;t have time for it. for better or worse, i feel like i carry a lot of weight from my ancestors. hopes and dreams from people who lived through incredibly difficult times are in my blood. </p><p>obviously i have the freedom to do whatever i want with my life. and yet, i feel a responsibility to do the most that i can with the life and energy i have been gifted. </p><p>not only that, but my parents spent a lot of time, energy, money, and family heartache to give my brother and me opportunities to do well (by conventional definitions). </p><p>and i feel like the best use of my time and energy is learning as much as i can as quickly as i can so that i can be the most effective change agent as possible. </p><p>and again, for better or worse, that means that i feel like if i&rsquo;m going to read, i want to read things that are going to give me the most tools and teach me the fastest. of course, i believe that fiction and narrative (and futurism) are important. but given my education and socioeconomic status, if i&rsquo;m going to read, i want to read something that&rsquo;s going to make me a more effective change agent and fast. i loved reading ender&rsquo;s game and i learned a ton from it. and reading books like pedagogy of the oppressed and resilience taught me just as much, if not more, in less time. </p><p>also, real life is crazy enough. sometimes even watching the news is surreal. to read fiction seems superfluous to me much of the time because real life is crazy enough.</p><p>so yea. that&rsquo;s why i don&rsquo;t read fiction. </p><p>sorry, not sorry.</p>
