<p>i had this thought yesterday while writing some <a href="http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/2017/01/08/2016-09-03-habit-breaking-tips-replacing-one-habit-for/">specific tips to help make personal systems change.</a><br/></p><p>change is hard. pretty much always. changing yourself might be one of the hardest types of change there is. and in every change process i&rsquo;ve ever been a part of or observed, there has always been some amount of failure. <br/></p><p>last year i committed to a personal meditation practice. 10 minutes a day. that&rsquo;s all i wanted to do. when i looked back at my 2015 data (which i was collecting through <a href="http://www.reporter-app.com/">reporter</a> at the time), i had meditated about 250 days. so there were clearly days that i didn&rsquo;t keep my own promise. <br/></p><p>but whenever i would miss a day, it was really important to be forgiving to myself and then keep trying. there are lots of reasons for being forgiving to yourself, most of which i think are good. the reason i&rsquo;m forgiving to myself is because i know that it takes time to change habits. but i&rsquo;ve also seen that if i just keep trying, the change eventually does stick. this year (2016), not only have i missed just two days of morning meditation, but i&rsquo;ve also added on a morning writing practice. my success rate with the writing (107/246) is lower than the meditation (244/246), but i know that if i keep it up, next year my stats will improve. </p><p>so yeah. failure is a part of the process. be forgiving of yourself. keep pushing. it&rsquo;ll happen.</p><p>ps - Â i think the reason i&rsquo;m so passionate about personal change is that i really believe that that&rsquo;s where the revolution starts. i&rsquo;m constantly seeking ways to change myself and now i&rsquo;m increasingly interested in supporting others to do the same. </p>
