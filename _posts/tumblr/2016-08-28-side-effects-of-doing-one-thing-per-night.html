<p>i&rsquo;ve realized that doing one thing per night has lots of pretty great side effects. well, they&rsquo;re not all side effects exactly, but whatever. you&rsquo;ll get the point.<br/></p><h2>building my no muscle</h2><p>in order to only do one thing per night, i have to say no to a lot of invitations. i have <a href="http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/2017/01/08/2016-05-28-on-saying-no/">lots of strong feelings about why saying no is so important</a> and they&rsquo;re all at play here. sometimes the no&rsquo;s are to specific events at specific times; other times they no&rsquo;s are just to keep things off my plate. either way, limiting my schedule really requires that i say no often and practice makes perfect, right?</p><h2>my spending has gone way down*</h2><p>doing fewer things means spending less money. i&rsquo;ve found that now i actually don&rsquo;t feel bad at all about dropping money on hanging out with people. i know i&rsquo;m not ever going to overspend because i know i have a limited number of engagements at which to spend money.</p><p>and doing cheap things when you do things also helps to reduce spending even more. i love going on walks for many reasons (<a href="http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/2017/01/08/2016-06-11-why-i-go-on-walks/">which you can check out here</a>) or just bringing my own snacks/drinks. </p><p>so, doing one thing per night has been a really great practice. and the more i do it, the more beneficial it becomes. </p><p>so dope.</p><p>* my friend caroline used to run these workshops on enough and i think i want to write about them soon because the findings from them are super relevant here.</p>
