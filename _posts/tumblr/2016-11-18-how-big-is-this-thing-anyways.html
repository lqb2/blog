<p>earlier this week, i had lunch with my friend danya and she made a really insightful comment (rough paraphrase): &ldquo;part of what&rsquo;s so weird right now is that we still don&rsquo;t know how big this problem is. it seems different everyday. it&rsquo;s weird to know how to act when you&rsquo;re not sure what you&rsquo;re responding to.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>i think she was dead on. last week and at the beginning of this week, <a href="http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/2017/01/08/2016-11-13-mourning/">i was still in mourning</a> and definitely wasn&rsquo;t ready to act. now i&rsquo;ve started to see some ways to act, but it&rsquo;s definitely still not clear to me what&rsquo;s going to be the most strategic. </p><p>every morning it seems like there&rsquo;s some new front to be paying attention to. nathanael points out that trump says he&rsquo;s not going to roll back marriage equality and yet he&rsquo;s appointing anti-gay judges. that&rsquo;s a fight in the making. maggie share’s <a href="http://blackamericaweb.com/2016/11/13/donald-trumps-10-point-plan-for-black-america-will-it-work/">trump&rsquo;s bullshit ten-point plan for black america</a>. she and phil both point out its absurdity. anyone (with any sort of racial or oppression analysis) who has experienced or studied cities knows that his language is a smokescreen. &ldquo;reduce crime&rdquo; means change laws to put as many people in jail as possible (apparently, this is already happening on the west coast). &ldquo;school choice&rdquo; means de-funding public schools. &ldquo;equal justice and applying the law fairly&rdquo; means inequity, because we currently aren&rsquo;t all equal; having marijuana in a packback can put you in prison, but shutting down the economy gets you a bonus.</p><p>right now it seems like there&rsquo;s a lot of energy to keep bannon from getting appointed. it&rsquo;s unclear to me if that&rsquo;s a distraction. obviously it will be helpful either way, but are we rallying people&rsquo;s attention and energy around that while missing other insidious things happening in the background? or things we haven&rsquo;t actually been presented with yet?</p><p>i&rsquo;m tired.</p>
