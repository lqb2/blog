<p>one of the latest <a href="http://www.onbeing.org/program/elizabeth-gilbert-choosing-curiosity-over-fear/8786">on being episodes is an interview with elizabeth gilbert</a>. creating came up and she shared an insight that resonates with how i have seen and experienced creativity. rather than creativity being fully mastered by the creator or fully a gift of inspiration, it&rsquo;s actually probably a mixture of both.<br/></p><p>on the one hand, some creators take all the credit for their brilliance. these are the &ldquo;i worked hard for years and years and that explains my skill and amazingness.&rdquo; on the other hand are the vessel creatives. their line of thinking is &ldquo;i&rsquo;m just a vessel. i wait for inspiration and then i act on it when it comes.&rdquo; </p><p>to gilbert (and me), neither feels totally right. she believes that the world&rsquo;s best creators inhabit a place in between these two theories. it&rsquo;s not completely up to you when inspiration comes, but you can prepare and be ready for it when it hits. </p><p>this makes a ton of sense to me and lines up with lots of my own experiences. she gives many examples of other artists over history who have verbalized this middle-ground and i&rsquo;ve heard many as well. basically the trick is show up and work every day so that when a brilliant idea or song or painting or design fix or whatever hits, you have exactly the right tools and processes in place to make it come to life.</p><p>and to wrap things up, here are two relevant quotes that i can&rsquo;t find the sources for, so i&rsquo;ll just paraphrase for now:<br/></p><ul><li>&ldquo;luck happens to everyone, but some of us are more ready than others to seize and capitalize on it.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;good things happen to those who work hard.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>ps - i think this is a great piece of good news. this thinking takes being a &ldquo;creative&rdquo; out of the realm of exclusivity. everyone already can be (or already is) a creative; we just don&rsquo;t yet have human systems to recognize and capitalize on that.</p><p>pps - i think this thinking has a strong parallel in the free will vs predestination conversation. whether talking philosophy, creativity, or spiritually, i think Â it&rsquo;s a both in all these cases. maybe all those sacred texts aren&rsquo;t divine because they&rsquo;re literally the word of God, but because they were written by people who were dedicated and wrote down the good stuff when it came through. hm!</p>
