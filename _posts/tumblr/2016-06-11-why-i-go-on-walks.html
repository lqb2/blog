<p>when a new connection or old friend wants to meet up, getting coffee or grabbing a drink is a common request. i know that speaks a lot to my socioeconomic class, but it is what it is. <br/></p><p>about a year ago, however, i started counter-offering with walks instead. in 2015, i had two friends with whom i would go on walks regularly&hellip; and it was awesome. one friend and i work in the same neighborhood so we would walk home from work. the other i would meet up with (sometimes with dinner on the front-end) and we&rsquo;d walk and talk for 2-3 hours. also awesome.</p><p>i have a couple of inspirations for these walking sessions.</p><ol><li>judy layzer. my late academic advisor was known for having walking meetings with her friends and close students. at her memorial service, it was a real bonding experience to share stories of walking with her.</li><li>they&rsquo;re cheap. walking is free. i can bring homemade snacks if i want. coffee and alcohol are expensive. i believe in supporting local watering holes, but sometimes i just don&rsquo;t have the money.</li><li>i don&rsquo;t drink coffee past the morning hours because <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sleep-newzzz/201312/new-details-caffeine-s-sleep-disrupting-effects">it screws up my sleep</a>. often people want to &ldquo;get coffee&rdquo; after work&hellip; which doesn&rsquo;t really work for me. walking can happen any time of day (mostly).</li><li>they&rsquo;re transportation. when i need to get from one part of town to another, walking is a great way to do it. especially when i can find someone who is going the same direction, a walk can be there perfect amount of time to catch up while also being pragmatic. <br/></li><li>they help me know my city. there are few ways to get to know your neighborhood and city better than by walking through them.</li></ol><p>plus, boston is the original walking city, right? </p>
