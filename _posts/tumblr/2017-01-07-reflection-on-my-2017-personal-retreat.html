<p>earlier this week i completed my third personal reflection retreat. the roadmap for it is <a href="http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/2017/01/08/2016-12-23-my-personal-retreat-long-version/">over here</a> so i&rsquo;m not gonna rehash that in this post. this post is just general thoughts, what went well, and what i think would make it better next year.<br/></p><h2>general thoughts</h2><p>i love doing this. why don&rsquo;t they teach people to do stuff like this in school or religion or other cultural institutions? maybe they do and i missed it. anyway, having three (mostly) offline days to look back and plan for the year just felt really good. </p><p>as always, i was surprised at how much happens in a calendar year. the process of building my 52 weekly summaries highlights from my calendar just how much i did and time i spent. i always see stuff that i forgot happened and i&rsquo;m continually reminded about the first thing on <a href="http://gretchenrubin.com/happiness_project/2014/10/heres-my-habits-manifesto-whats-yours/">gretchen rubin&rsquo;s habit manifesto</a>: what you do regularly matters more than what you do once in a while. </p><p>this might sound corny, but i feel like a new person with an entirely new set of possibilities after reviewing what happened last year. i think this is because i had no idea what was possible in 2016 when i did my jan 2016 retreat. and then looking back on the year from now it’s like&hellip; well if <i>that’s </i>what happened based on what i thought would happen, who <i>knows</i> what could happen this year?</p><h2>what went well (+s)</h2><ul><li>free housing (was house-sitting for friends in central square)</li><li>prepping agenda beforehand</li><li>had company (spencer) visiting from the uk which both helped keep me focused and also made for good breaks</li><li>finalizing a draft of my <a href="http://infinitegrowth.rocks/">infinite growth</a> vision statement supported my planning for 2017 so much; it’s so crazy that we walk around the world without compasses</li><li>marking a whole day to do project launch prep work was great<br/></li></ul><h2>what could&rsquo;ve been better (∆s)</h2><ul><li>i didn&rsquo;t disconnect from my cell phone; this cost me lots of focus</li><li>didn&rsquo;t get to everything</li><li>every year i&rsquo;ve felt like i want more time and this year was the same; next year (assuming i make it that far) i&rsquo;ll do four days</li><li>would have been nice to have prepped my budget review beforehand (maybe on dec 31st?)</li></ul>
