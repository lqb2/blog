<p>for most of my life i have been very clear with myself and with others about intentionally removing pop stars from my sphere of care. not that i don’t care about them as people, but i have little interest in following along in their personal affairs. this baffles many of my friends. they genuinely can’t understand why i still don’t know the difference between leonardo dicaprio and hugh jackman.<br/></p><p>i’ve always said that i don’t follow pop stars because i would rather know my neighbors. i would rather save brain space for information about people who personally care about me and whom i care about.</p><p>recently, i learned about dunbar’s number (<a href="http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/2017/01/08/2016-05-07-can-you-be-over-networked/">in my post about being over-networked</a>). i also have learned (<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.onbeing.org%2F&amp;t=N2U5YmZkNGRiYTE3ZjlhNjQ0YTQ1MmNlN2I4MTE4NzIwMWY4MGQ2OSxzS25Fc29JYQ%3D%3D">probably from an episode of onbeing, though i can’t remember which one</a>) that our brains don’t differentiate between digital relationships and face-to-face relationships. finally, i know from personal experience that social media and ubiquitous computing (via cell phones) now allow us to follow the lives of pop stars minute by minute if we want.<br/></p><p>all of this to me points to one really terrible conclusion: closely following the lives of pop stars and media figures literally limits the number of intimate connections we can have. our brains actually can’t hold more than a certain number of faces and relationships. for every pop star that someone follows intimately, that’s one less person they can be close with in their actual community.</p><p>so now i feel justified in my approach to just not give a fuck about who got married to who in 1998. i don’t want to know the names of that movie star’s kids. i want to save my brain space for people who live in my community (<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Freformedreader.wordpress.com%2F2011%2F11%2F18%2Fwendell-berry-on-community%2F&amp;t=N2U0OGNmZWJhYjNlZWY4ZDEwMWE2NGFlZTkzMmVhZTYzNWI1MjlhNSxzS25Fc29JYQ%3D%3D">wendell berry style</a>).</p><p>oops.</p>
