<p>i started this year with <a href="http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/2017/01/08/2016-01-08-constrained-creativity/">a commitment to myself</a>. i called it constrained creativity:<br/></p><blockquote><p>“&hellip;everyday. fewer than 200 words. 10 minutes or less (including editing, not including research). whatever is on my mind. public. (mostly) not fact checked.”<br/></p></blockquote><p> i mostly started it to get over my writing anxiety. eventually, i realized it was helpful to have my thoughts in a sharable format. now i spend 20-30 minutes writing and lightly editing posts every day. it&rsquo;s been a journey, but i&rsquo;m doing it and now it feels strange to not! habit built.</p><p>a few weeks ago, my friend miriam told me she used <a href="http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/2017/01/08/2016-11-19-why-the-safety-pin-backlash-makes-me-sad/">my blog post about the safety pin backlash</a> to have a conversation with a friend. the first thought when i heard that was &ldquo;wow! this is great and also fucking terrifying.&rdquo; <br/></p><p>neither of them agreed (fully) with me, but she said having a piece of content neither of them created helped them walk through each of their issues related to the subject matter. they used it as a foundation on which to discuss about their own thoughts. <br/></p><p>honestly (truly), one part of me is freaking out about this. i’ve heard of a few other stories like this from other friends and it&rsquo;s insane. people are reading <b>my</b> thoughts and then <b>sharing</b> them with other friends. what??!?!?!?!!<br/></p><p>part of the thinking behind writing in a public place was so that i could share it. but it also means that if other people want to share it and discuss it, they can. at the beginning of this year i couldn&rsquo;t even hit publish more than once a week and now here we are. <br/></p><p>monthly post numbers:</p><p>jan: 12<br/>feb: 3<br/>mar: 4<br/>apr: 3<br/>may: 9<br/>june: 16<br/>july: 21<br/>aug: 29<br/>sept: 36<br/>oct: 26<br/>nov: 29<br/>dec: 36 (including this post)</p><p>i don&rsquo;t really have any plans on stopping and listening to <a href="https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-205-ezra-klein">this interview with ezra klein on the podcast longform</a> is really inspiring me (thanks for the tip ac valdez from <a href="https://www.showaboutrace.com/episodes/1652">show about race</a>).<br/></p><p>anyway, all that to say&hellip; i guess we’re doing this. here&rsquo;s to 2017!</p><p>writing: 10:01<br/>​spell-check, link-finding, &amp; formatting: 22:56<br/></p>
