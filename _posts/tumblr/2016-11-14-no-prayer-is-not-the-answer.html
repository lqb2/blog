<p>i am pretty disturbed by the number of times since trump was elected that i&rsquo;ve heard variations on prayer being the solution. it has sounded like:<br/></p><ul><li>&ldquo;all we can do now is pray that it doesn&rsquo;t get terrible.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;pray for him and his people.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;i&rsquo;m praying that you stay safe and you do the same for me.&rdquo;</li></ul><p>if i&rsquo;m honest, it&rsquo;s crazy talk like this that made me run from church. although i realize that there are conflicting bible verses about whether prayer on its own is effective or whether it must be combined with action, it just doesn&rsquo;t make sense to me that sitting or kneeling and thinking is itself going to have any serious impact on anything. i don&rsquo;t want my friends to pray for my safety, i want them to actually do things that help keep me safe. and vice versa: i&rsquo;m not just going to sit in my bed and think about my family and friends being safe. i&rsquo;m going to take action that ensures they stay safe. and if those actions seem impossible, i&rsquo;m going to encourage them like hell to get out. <br/></p><p>last week, i found myself saying to ross, &ldquo;i&rsquo;m really hoping this doesn&rsquo;t go as badly as it could&hellip;&rdquo; he responded, &ldquo;will be up to the righteous to ensure that.&rdquo;</p><p>faith without deeds is dead. and so we go forward, with hope and action, both.</p><p>ps - i don’t often still refer to the bible, but i do remember that james 2: 14-26 used to really resonate with me. for the most part, that passage still does.</p><blockquote><p><sup>14 </sup>What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith <sup></sup>but does not have works? Can that faith save him? <sup>15 </sup><sup></sup>If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, <sup>16 </sup><sup></sup>and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good<sup>[<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=James+2%3A14-26&amp;version=ESV#fen-ESV-30293a" title="See footnote a">a</a>]</sup> is that? <sup>17 </sup>So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.</p><p><sup>18 </sup>But someone will say, “You have faith and I have works.” Show me your faith <sup></sup>apart from your works, and I will show you my faith <sup></sup>by my works. <sup>19 </sup><sup></sup>You believe that God is one; you do well. Even <sup></sup>the demons believe—and shudder! <sup>20 </sup>Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless?<sup>21 </sup><sup></sup>Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar? <sup>22 </sup>You see that <sup></sup>faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed <sup></sup>by his works; <sup>23 </sup>and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, <sup></sup>“Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness”—and he was called a <sup></sup>friend of God. <sup>24 </sup>You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.<sup>25 </sup>And in the same way was not also <sup></sup>Rahab the prostitute justified by works <sup></sup>when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way? <sup>26 </sup>For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead.</p></blockquote>
