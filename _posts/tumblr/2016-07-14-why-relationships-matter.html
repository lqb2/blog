<p>last week, i wrote a post about sprinters and marathoners and how my friend ross and i fit into those roles. when i mentioned my think to him he said, &hellip;&ldquo;funny how you define something I’ve never really thought about myself, but now know.&rdquo;</p><p>when he said that i realized yet another reason why relationships are so important. relationships teach us about ourselves in ways we could never learn without them.</p><p>this fits into so many frames through which i&rsquo;ve been thinking lately. it fits into bell hooks&rsquo; understanding of love and intimate relationship because being in a loving relationship with someone is actually a really hard thing to do [link to quote tumblr post]. though many of us are trained to want and seek love, most aren&rsquo;t ready for it. hooks believes that being loved by someone means they are going to want you to grow [link to definition] and that means telling you things about yourself that they see as hinderances to your own progress.</p><p>it fits into gretchen rubin&rsquo;s frame of the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}2016/07/13/gretchen-rubin-on-the-secrets-to-happiness/">things happy people have</a>.</p><p>and it also fits into my upbringing as a christian. love in christianity, at least in my understanding, is demonstrated primarily through relationships with people. love and relationship also show up in much of the christian writers i revered such as wendell berry, c.s. lewis, st. augustine, g.k. chesterton, and dietrich bonhoeffer.</p><p>finally, there&rsquo;s this thing called <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/CommSkll/JohariWindow.htm">the johari window</a> which was going to be the full subject of today’s post, but i guess i’ll have to write about tomorrow&hellip;</p>
