<p>this morning i wrote my 100th post. i&rsquo;m spending about 30 minutes per post these days. 20-25 on writing and 5-10 on research and light editing.  </p>

<p>i never thought this is where this experiment would be on sept 1st (i&rsquo;m way farther than i anticipated). given that, i&rsquo;m pretty pumped about how this could continue to grow.</p>
