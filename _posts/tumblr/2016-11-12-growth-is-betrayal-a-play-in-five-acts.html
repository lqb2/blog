<h2>act i: john updike – rabbit redux.</h2><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/46hxxq/growth_is_betrayal_there_is_no_other_route_there/">“Growth is betrayal. There is no other route. There is no arriving somewhere without leaving somewhere.”</a></p><h2>act ii: marie kondo – the life-changing magic of tidying up.<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/46hxxq/growth_is_betrayal_there_is_no_other_route_there/#">​</a></h2><p>&ldquo;Every object has a different role to play. Not all clothes have come to you to be worn threadbare. It is the same with people. Not every person you meet in life will become a close friend or lover. Some you will find hard to get along with or impossible to like. But these people, too, teach you the precious lesson of who you do like, so that you will appreciate those special people even more.</p><p>When you come across something that you cannot part with, think carefully about its true purpose in your life. You&rsquo;ll be surprised at how many of the things you possess have already fulfilled their role. By acknowledging their contribution and letting them go with gratitude, you will be able to truly put the things you own, and your life, in order. In the end, all that will remain are the things that you really treasure. </p><p>To truly cherish the things that are important to you, you must first discard those that have outlived their purpose… this is neither wasteful nor shameful.&rdquo;</p><h2>act iii: bell hooks – all about love.</h2><p>&ldquo;While forgiveness is essential to spiritual growth, it does not make everything immediately wonderful or fine. Often, New Age writing on the subject of love makes it seem as though everything will always be wonderful if we are just loving. Realistically, being part of a loving community does not mean we will not face conflicts, betrayals, negative outcomes from positive actions, or bad things happening to good people. Love allows us to confront these negative realities in a manner that is life-affirming and life-enhancing.&rdquo;<br/></p><h2>act iv: reinhold niebuhr.</h2><p>&ldquo;Love is the motive, but justice is the instrument.&rdquo;<br/></p><h2>act v: bell hooks – all about love.</h2><p>&ldquo;Usually we imagine that true love will be intensely pleasurable and romantic, full of love and light. In truth, true love is all about work. The poet Rainer Maria Rilke wisely observed: &lsquo;Like so much else, people have also misunderstood the place of love in life, they have made it into play and pleasure because they thought that play and pleasure was more blissful than work; but there is nothing happier than work, and love, just because it is the extreme happiness, can be nothing else but work&hellip;&rsquo; The essence of true love is mutual recognition—two individuals seeing each other as they really are.&rdquo;</p>
