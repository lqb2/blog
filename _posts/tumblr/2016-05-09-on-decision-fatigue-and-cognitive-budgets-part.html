<p>if you haven&rsquo;t read part 1 of this post, <a href="https://lqb2.github.io/blog/2016/04/17/on-decision-fatigue-and-cognitive-budgets-part-1/">give it a read</a>. it&rsquo;s short, i promise. <br/></p><p>given limited cognitive budget, we are each then daily presented with a maximization problem. how should we make the most of a limited resource (your brain&rsquo;s capacity to make good decisions)?</p><p>now, for a while i was fascinated by high profile thinkers and leaders. i thought that if i could follow their patterns, i could do things on par with them. what i&rsquo;ve learned from reading about and listening to some of these folks is this: do as much as  you can to take small decisions out of your day and create as much time as possible for doing ‘heavy-thinking.&rsquo; heavy-thinking tasks to me are ones that require me to juggle a lot of complexity, let it all roll around in my head for a while, process it, and then create something with it. for me, that thing is almost always a design of some sort. whether it&rsquo;s a project design, a piece of visual design, or design of a process, i still need long blocks of uninterrupted time (i.e. <a href="http://blog.trello.com/why-context-switching-ruins-productivity/">no context switching</a>) to process information thoroughly and spit it back out in a way that has added value. </p><p>so for me (and these &lsquo;greats&rsquo; as well) the common thread is minimizing small decisions to create space for big decisions (like how to implement a 12-month data gathering program for my organization). </p><p>and, surprise surprise, the easiest way to do that is having routines. everything you can do to take small decisions off your plate (especially in the morning) and put them into a routine helps. this is why people make such a big deal out of picking your clothes the night before. the comparative cognitive cost of choosing what to wear is much less at the end of a day than at the beginning of one. <br/></p><p>there are some common themes, especially within particular fields. that said, having studied many fields and many eras of top-notch thinkers and doers, here&rsquo;s my conclusion. it doesn&rsquo;t particularly matter what your routine is; it matters that you have one that works for you.</p>
