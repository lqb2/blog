<p>sidenote: this post and the next one or two i write (i think) are both going to be about death. </p><p>i&rsquo;m fairly obsessed with the american anti-obsession with death. the lengths american society goes to to avoid thinking about, dealing with, seeing in real ways, and coping with the fact that we&rsquo;re all going to die one day are amazing. i think a large portion of the issues american society faces flow from this aversion. i could go on and on about this, but that&rsquo;s not the point.</p><p>the point today is to start dealing with it myself. and i&rsquo;ll start with my own death (because i almost always think the place to start in in oneself). i think this may become an annual tradition. who knows. here goes:<br/></p><p>it&rsquo;s nearing the end of 2016 and i&rsquo;m thinking about my death. </p><p>my first thought: i am resigned to the reality that one way or another, the oppressive systems we live in will probably kill me. if it&rsquo;s not a bullet or other direct assault from a human it may be the climate and resulting catastrophe or it may be cancer from the toxic environments/lifestyles we&rsquo;ve created for ourselves.<br/></p><p>so be it. <br/></p><p>or maybe I&rsquo;ll die of old age and my body ceasing to function in a way that keeps my soul in it. that&rsquo;s fine, too. it feels less likely, but hey, nothing&rsquo;s impossible. and maybe i&rsquo;ll look back at this when i&rsquo;m 90 and think &ldquo;what a ridiculous thing i wrote.&rdquo; <br/></p><p>either way, this note about my death is actually about how i want to live (knowing that i will die):<br/></p><ul><li>i hope that some people i crossed paths with know what it feels like to be loved because of me<br/></li><li>i hope that people and the world are better because of my life, relationships, and work<br/></li><li>i would love to be a part of ending hunger worldwide</li><li>i hope to be part of bringing about new ways of living that help people live lives more aligned with their true selves, people arond them, and the planet</li><li>if there&rsquo;s an afterlife, i hope that the things i did while alive land me on the side of it where there&rsquo;s contentment</li></ul><p>whether i die later today, tomorrow, or in some years, i hope i&rsquo;m able to genuinely <a href="http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/2017/01/08/2016-03-28-timelines-of-change-living-everyday-like-its-the/">live every day like it&rsquo;s my last and also like i&rsquo;ll live till i’m old</a>.</p><p>ps - also, i didn&rsquo;t commit suicide. if shit gets crazy, don&rsquo;t let anyone tell you i killed myself. i will never kill myself. if you hear it on tape, i was tortured. i promise. <a href="http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/2017/01/08/2016-03-15-two-defining-factors/%5D">i have already died once</a> and that experience taught me that life is much too precious to willingly end. </p><h2>resources</h2><ul><li><a href="https://stories.californiasunday.com/2015-04-05/death-redesigned">death, redesigned</a><br/></li><li><a href="https://www.fastcodesign.com/3044079/asides/ideo-tried-to-redesign-dying-and-instead-ended-up-with-death-yurts">the backlash to death, redesigned</a></li><li><a href="http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/2017/01/08/2016-10-16-america-a-nation-founded-on-genocide-and-trauma/">america: a nation founded on genocide and trauma that is afraid to acknowledge death and grief</a><br/></li><li><br/></li></ul><p>writing: 18:36<br/>spell-check, link-finding, &amp; formatting: 9:11<br/></p>
