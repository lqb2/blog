<p>last night, a friend i&rsquo;m working on a project with said to me you&rsquo;re the &ldquo;#1 most organized person i know.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>i&rsquo;m coming to realize that have a keen awareness of how to organize systems. i think i&rsquo;ve already written about this once this year. </p><p>as i walked to the train this morning, i had a revelation that doing organizing work is how i should economically support myself. it comes to me SO naturally. even in the past few weeks, i&rsquo;ve given away several pieces of advice that have been helpful to friends. of course, i will continue to do that and i think i&rsquo;ll start planning how to earn income with those same skills. </p><p>after some calendar coaching, one of the guys i mentor said &ldquo;can&rsquo;t wait to talk&ndash; really trying to stick to calendar. it is amazing to track what i actually do every day. thank you, lawrence.&rdquo;</p><p>erin g-h said &ldquo;#1 most organized person i know&rdquo;</p><p>cyndi asked &ldquo;how do you keep up with all these tools and always have exactly the right tool for the right purpose?&rdquo;</p><p>jonathan asked for advice in the future on personal budgeting systems.</p><p>maybe i should start a consulting firm.</p>
