<p>i died once. so time matters a lot to me. how i use it and how i don’t. </p><p>so i combine a lot of tools to make sure that if i die again (which i will), i won’t regret my time. and so that i will have genuinely felt like i accomplished something with my lifeforce.</p>

<p>so things i do include: pomodoros + early morning productivity + getting things done (doing the right thing/work in the right moment with the proper energy in the right context) + airplane mode + email in the afternoon + prioritize prioritize prioritize.<br/></p>
