<p>back in may, i was talking with a new friend and colleague, deina, about travel. she and i were talking about traveling in the united states between new england, the south, and the west. she and i both had trips planned and we were just chatting about it all.</p><p>and then she said something that stuck with me:</p><p>&ldquo;in america, you can really choose what type of lifestyle you want. cities, rural, busy, quiet, crowded, not crowded; it&rsquo;s all here. it&rsquo;s not like that everywhere.&rdquo;</p><p>and i just sort of sat with that for a second. she&rsquo;s totally right. without leaving my country, i can see mountains, beaches, tundra, forest, desert, and more. without crossing any international borders (which is an increasingly prominent social problem these days), i can see all of that. having the resources to do that travel so is a different question, but still.</p><p>as our conversation continued, she explained that not only do americans have access to those places, but we can choose to live in almost any one of them. again, not a common global phenomenon. where she&rsquo;s from, pretty much everyone lives in the same condition.</p><p>and, if i&rsquo;m honest, i&rsquo;ve always known that, but i hadn&rsquo;t known it in this way until she surfaced it. this is a huge privilege (i think). but what to do with it (if anything?)</p><p>a couple of friends (annemarie, cameron, ben, miriam, others) have this dream of having a network of houses all over the country (world?) where we can collectively exist, raise our families, work, vacation, etc&hellip; maybe?</p>
