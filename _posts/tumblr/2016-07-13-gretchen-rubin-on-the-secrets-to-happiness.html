<p>one of the latest episodes of design matters is an <a href="https://soundcloud.com/designmatters/design-matters-with-debbie-millman-gretchen-rubin">interview with gretchen rubin</a>. it&rsquo;s a brilliant interview and a huge portion of it addresses her <a href="http://gretchenrubin.com/books/the-happiness-project/about-the-book/">recent book on happiness (the happiness project)</a>. whether or not they seem to be trying to, almost everything in the conversation wraps back around to being happy.</p><p>of course, debbie (the interviewer) flat out asked what the secrets to happiness are. and, of course, nothing was incredibly surprising but it&rsquo;s still worth sharing. there were many parts to the answer so here are the three that stuck out most to me.</p><p><b>answer part 1</b>: once, when gretchen was working for supreme court justice sandra day o'connor, she asked the justice that very question: what&rsquo;s the secret to happiness? justice o'connor, without missing a beat, responded &ldquo;work worth doing.&rdquo;</p><p><b>answer part 2</b>: gretchen referenced several academic research studies on happiness. the threads that ran through them were (1) relationships and (2) self-knowledge. people who had strong, meaningful relationships and knew themselves well were the happiest over time. there are likely many reasons for that and i could write a whole post about each of those, but i&rsquo;ll pass for now.</p><p><b>answer part 3</b>: growth. for some reason, people are just happier when they&rsquo;re growing something. over time and place, that has looked very different. sometimes it&rsquo;s a garden, other times it&rsquo;s a family, and other times it can look like an empire or a business. i would hope as we grow in consciousness about what it will take to make human life, we can all &lsquo;grow&rsquo; things that are regenerative (instead of destructive) to the environment and each other, but regardless of what it is for each person, it makes a ton of sense to me that growing something is a critical part of being happy.</p><p>she also mentioned something about a happiness 'range&rsquo; and how to maximize it, but that seems like a post for later&hellip;</p>
