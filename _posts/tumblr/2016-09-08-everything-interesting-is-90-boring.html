<p>in <a href="http://www.onbeing.org/program/elizabeth-gilbert-choosing-curiosity-over-fear/8786">her interview on on being</a>, elizabeth gilbert shared a theory that really resonated with me. here&rsquo;s a paraphrase:<br/></p><p>&ldquo;i&rsquo;m developing a new theory: everything interesting is 90% boring. marriage, raising kids, even doing your dream work&hellip; it&rsquo;s all mostly boring. there are the moments when things are exciting and attention garnering and great. but those moments are few and far between. for the most part, it&rsquo;s putting in all the unglamorous time and work that makes awesome moments possible.<br/></p><p>this reality is a pitfall of people who follow their passions for career. they leave their boring, tedious day job only to realize with a shock that their passion work too is tedious and boring most of the time.&rdquo;<br/></p><p>this makes a shitton of sense to me. <br/></p><p>many a friend and acquaintance has mocked me for going to bed so early and getting up early. i often respond with, &ldquo;hey, boring people get shit done,&rdquo; and have been doing so for years. i think this is true because boring people understand how to push through the slog to the success point. &ldquo;boring people&rdquo; understand that meaningful, important is not all glamour and accolades. </p><p>i was even talking to my friend, ross, the other day about my allergy to being everywhere all the time. people who are everywhere all the time can&rsquo;t possibly have the time to put in the hard work to do anything really meaningful. </p><p>anyway, now for some quotes and anecdotes:</p><p>&ldquo;The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything.&rdquo;<br/>â€” Warren Buffett</p><p>ryder carroll, the creator of the now wildly popular bullet journal says he perfected the journal over 20 years before launching the concept officially three years ago. - <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-tech-savvy-to-do-list-a-bullet-journal-1473187188">wall street journal article</a> (ht <a href="https://twitter.com/Rchanowski">@rchanowski</a>)</p><p>&ldquo;it takes at least ten years to become an overnight success.&rdquo; </p><ul><li>here&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/keywords/overnight_success.html">a page of quotes about this idea</a></li><li>here&rsquo;s an releavnt inc article: <a href="http://www.inc.com/empact/why-successful-people-take-10-years-to-succeed-overnight.html">Why Successful People Take 10 Years to &lsquo;Succeed Overnight&rsquo;</a></li></ul><p>this concept is also related to a post i wrote the other day about how <a href="http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/2017/01/08/2016-09-06-creating-is-a-mixture-of-hard-work-and-inspiration/">creativity might be a combination of inspiration and hard work</a>.</p>
