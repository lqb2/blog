<p>i listened to the <a href="http://www.obsessedshow.com/episodes/samuel-e-vazquez">samuel vasquez episode of obsessed with design</a> recently and i was really inspired by his reasoning for starting a personal email newsletter. <br/></p><p>tbh, i was pretty critical of the practice up until i heard him explain why he started his. i thought it was pretty self-centered, self-aggrandizing, and mostly a form of personal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boosterism">boosterism</a>. <br/></p><p>but his logic and reasoning has totally changed my mind. in fact, he&rsquo;s changed my mind so much that i&rsquo;m planning to start one for myself in 2017. some of these reasons are his that i liked and some i came up with but here they are either way: </p><ul><li>let&rsquo;s people know what i&rsquo;m up to: more people ask me what i&rsquo;m up to than i can reasonably respond to (not tryna be an asshole here, that’s just literally true. i wouldn’t have time to do any actual work if i kept up with everyone i know). i think a weekly or bi-weekly newsletter email can keep people in the loop about what i&rsquo;m up to if they really want to know. the archive could also be a helpful tool as another form of <a href="http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/2017/01/08/2016-10-28-why-i-write/">personal public memory/reflection</a>. <br/></li><li>allows people to send things resources my way. being up to date about what i&rsquo;m doing i think could help people know what&rsquo;s relevant to send along if they want: articles, rpfs, proposals, and things like job postings.<br/></li><li>allows people to make connections based on things they&rsquo;re doing or seeing. whenever i update my job status on facebook, i get at least 2-3 people wanting to talk about work stuff. the newsletter could help people connect with me who are doing relevant work and want to either partner or think together or whatever.<br/></li><li>platform for sharing my writing. as i write more and hear how people appreciate it in different ways, i&rsquo;m learning that a distribution platform could be a helpful thing. maybe the email could have a list of all the posts i wrote that week or something.</li></ul><p>anyways, that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;ve got right now as reasons for starting a personal email newsletter for 2017. they may evolve or change, but let&rsquo;s see how it goes!</p><p>writing: 13:56<br/>spell-check, link-finding, &amp; formatting: 11:39<br/></p>
