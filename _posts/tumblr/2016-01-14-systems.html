<p>today a friend requested some help budgeting. he has seen my detailed attention to my evolving budgeting systems over the years. from manual spreadsheets in excel to mint and now simple. <br/></p><p>i am proud of the way i find ways to analyze a system, identify what&rsquo;s needed, and then find a long-term solution. and i&rsquo;ve found that the best solutions require a small amount of regular (up to daily) maintenance to achieve the goal. </p><p>this approach to systems reminds me of some off-hand my friend, nadeem, gave to a student at party. the student asked nadeem how to make a meaningful change. nadeem&rsquo;s response: do something for five minutes a day for a long time. the kid responded: wait, but shouldn&rsquo;t i do it for a few hours a week? nadeem: no no no, that&rsquo;s way too much. if you can do five minutes a day, see how you like it. if it works, you&rsquo;ll keep it up and do more. small, sustained acts over time is how we actually effect change.<br/></p><p>i concur.</p><p>see poem: <a href="http://www.grahameb.com/pinkola_estes.htm">http://www.grahameb.com/pinkola_estes.htm</a></p>
