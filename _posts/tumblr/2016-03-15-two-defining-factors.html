<p>as i get older, i have noticed that two significant &ldquo;events&rdquo; in my life have had a drastic impact on my way of being. the first is that i (clinically) died once. the second is my evolving relationship with christianity.<br/></p><h2>on death and dying</h2><p>when i was 16, i was in a terrible car accident that resulted in me flatlining for 3-4 seconds on an operating table. i woke up feeling great (painkillers), but confused. over the few months of my recovery, i learned how lucky i was to have survived. coming to grips with fact that easily could have not been lucky has completely changed how i think about life. i would even go so far as to say that i&rsquo;ve experienced an epigentic change. i was already a pretty driven kid, but after that, my approach to life took on a whole new rigor. this is consistent with many other people who have near death experiences.</p><h2>speaking of faith</h2><p>i grew up in a christian household, mostly hated it when i was very young, fell in love with the faith and the Church when i was a little older, became disillusioned in my early adult years, and became distantly enchanted as a mid-twenties adult. <br/></p><p>i have always believed strongly in the core values of christianity (love, mostly), but have consistently struggled with the hypocrisy evinced by mainstream american christians. this impacts how i live because i&rsquo;m able to hold the core values while eschewing the institutions. </p><p>turns out, this ability is surprising (and incredibly attractive) to people. it gives me a lot of joy to love and it seems people around me appreciate it and respond well to being loved.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>these two factors, having personally experienced death and holding onto christian values outside of the institution, i think make my worldview and approach pretty abnormal. i&rsquo;m a fan, though.</p>
