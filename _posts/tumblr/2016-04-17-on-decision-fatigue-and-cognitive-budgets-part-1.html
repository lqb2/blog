<p>a couple of months ago i was listening to the <a href="http://designobserver.com/feature/eric-zimmer/39210">eric zimmer episode of design matters</a>. eric mentioned an episode of his own podcast discussing <a href="http://www.oneyoufeed.net/mini-episode-decision-fatigue-power-routines/">decision fatigue and cognitive budgets</a>. even before he explained the terms, i understood where he was going. <br/></p><p>basically, every time you make a decision, it uses up some mental capacity. mental capacity is a finite resource. this means that everything you do over the course of a day (including decisions) takes up some of your daily &lsquo;cognitive budget.&rsquo; if you make too many decisions in a day, you experience decision fatigue. decision fatigue, for me, looks like massive productivity slow downs.</p><p>i love these ideas. they explain so much of the commonality between all the different work flow research and theory. they also explain why not sticking to my Â work flow structures makes things fall apart. examples:</p><ul><li>do your most important work of the day before you have a chance to be interrupted. processing interruptions requires decision-making, even if the decision is to defer or ignore.</li><li>when i have morning meetings, my days are less productive. meetings eat up a lot of cognitive budget. hence my allergy to morning meetings.</li><li>scheduling menial tasks for in the afternoon keeps my mornings focused on solving complex problems. my brain literally doesn&rsquo;t have energy to handle these late in the day.</li><li>picking out clothes the night before.</li></ul><p>anywho, more to come about this (and the all-important connection to routines) later. in the meantime, <a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/2014/06/most-productive-people/">this blog post</a> from <a href="http://www.bakadesuyo.com/">barking up the wrong tree</a> has lots of relevant research and thinking. it changed my life. </p><p>follow on to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}2016/05/09/on-decision-fatigue-and-cognitive-budgets-part/">part 2 right here</a>.</p>
