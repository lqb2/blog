<p>today, i cried twice before sunrise. </p><p>ross says writing helps.<br/>so i write.<br/></p><p>manny, nene, anna, and erin inspire.</p><p>last night, i put my head in the sand.<br/>kept it there until 7am.<br/>intentionally.</p><p>six months ago, i planned to be in montréal for the election.<br/>i knew it could happen. <br/>some people pretend to not know what america is.<br/>some people actually do not know what america is. <br/>non-americans know what america is. <br/>black people know what america is. <br/>brown people know.<br/>women know. <br/>trans people know. <br/>non-binary people know. <br/>native people know. </p><p>some people do not know. </p><p>i call nse. <br/>we talk about the sadness and the fear.<br/>and then we talk about work.</p><p>“keep building, keep pushing, love on each other.”</p><p>i check facebook incessantly. <br/>i start a running file of everyone’s statuses.<br/>watching the waves.</p><p>i avoid twitter. <br/>it gets in anyways. </p><p>jason tells me a group of kkk members was spotted this morning on a bridge in north carolina. </p><p>this is america. in 2016. the fucking kkk. </p><p>i heard from chuck that people i know and love (loved? love.) voted trump.<br/>attempted to convince others to vote trump. to vote hate. <br/>i left florida for this. </p><p>now i sit outside america. <br/>wondering.<br/></p><p>do i go back? <br/>i must.<br/>musn’t i?</p><p>i can’t go on.<br/>i must go on. </p><p>soup poop.<br/>just now. <br/>i wrote a 30 word email.<br/>in 30 minutes.</p><p>the sun shines. <br/>but i don’t understand. </p><p>how? </p><p>abe says trump is the final boss. </p><p>the empire is falling.<br/>it does not look like i thought it would. </p><p>my stomach hurts.<br/>my fingers twitch. </p><p>i oscillate between anger, sadness, fear&hellip;<br/>and excitement. </p><p>maybe we have to do this now. </p><p>the civil rights moved us down the field.<br/>but we’re not done yet. </p><p>this is america. </p><p>i meet ambroise’s brother for coffee.<br/>we hope. laugh. dream. </p><p>we can still learn. <br/>even through this.</p><p>i am reminded that we have always rejected our parents’ systems. <br/>they believed the government would fix things.<br/>they made it strong. er.<br/>we disbelieve. <br/>so now we must work.</p><p>“forward ever, backward never.”</p><p>oops?</p><p>barack obama. <br/>donald trump.<br/>same system. </p><p>how?</p><p>the “great” american experiment. </p><p>he lost the popular vote.<br/>electoral college pulls him through.<br/></p><p>it’s all stolen. <br/>dreams. <br/>fairy dust. <br/>lies. </p><p>and yet&hellip;<br/>there are no demons. they are not demons.</p><p>hate will not solve this.<br/>the fear that put him in office is real.<br/>from where did it come? <br/></p><p>pushback.<br/>backlash.<br/>blacklash.<br/>invisibility. </p><p>texts roll in:<br/>i love you.<br/>i love you, too.<br/>we should’ve gotten married when we could.<br/>we should still get married.<br/>i need a hug. <br/>don’t come back.<br/>come back.</p><p>what is the future now?<br/>everything i wished for is thrown off course.<br/>my dreams, my work, my energy, my time. <br/>what will it look like?<br/>who knows. </p><p>what now? </p><p>who knows.  </p><p>will i regret writing this? no. <br/>will i regret making it public? maybe.</p><p>who knows.</p><p>soundtrack: laura mvula. </p><p>i have cried 4x today. it’s not even 1pm.<br/></p>
