<p>my <a href="http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/2017/01/08/2016-03-15-two-defining-factors/">two defining factors</a> completely structure my life (which, at the ground level, means my time). i know, from experience, how quickly death can come. i also know, that love (the action(s)) is the single most important thing in life.<br/></p><p>because i know those two things, i really try to live like every day could be my last. i used to hear people spout that pithy line and roll my eyes&hellip; hard. but now, i feel like i actually live it. and it&rsquo;s a lot less cheesy than i thought.<br/></p><p>in my day to day, living like today could be my last day simply means that i always (always) need to have immediate-, medium-, and long-term ways that i&rsquo;m creating or influencing change to make the world a more loving place. driving for change on several timelines at once means that if i died tomorrow, i would feel confident in saying that i was making a difference. since i see almost everything through a systems lens, the outcome of all this is just a structure that helps me make decisions. </p><p>but i think i have to save that for another post.</p><p>update (23 june 2016): finally wrote <a href="http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/2017/01/08/2016-06-19-why-i-plan-my-schedule-six-weeks-in-advance/">that other post</a>. </p>
