<p>over the past few months I’ve had at least three friends talk to me about being unhappy in boston. these are high-functioning, awesome individuals so i don’t think their unhappiness has anything to do with anything they’re doing wrong.</p><p>i think i’m coming to recognize that that the style and pace of life in boston (maybe as it is in all cities) simply doesn’t align with how some people thrive.</p><p>when i think back to my gainesville days, i remember the pace of life as back, spontaneous, and communities were tightly-knit. it didn’t take much effort at all to get 4-8 people together on any given weekend.</p><p>boston life, on the other hand, is fast-paced, high energy, and it takes a concerted effort to form community. whether it&rsquo;s going to some event or speaker series or talk&hellip; there’s always something going on and people are always busy. hanging out with people 1on1 takes 1-2 weeks notice.  even seeing close friends can be tricky because there are so many different places to expend ones energy.</p><p>i&rsquo;m beginning to wonder if some of my friends aren&rsquo;t thriving in boston because they just need a different pace. there&rsquo;s also something about how the pace impacts the gravity of community&hellip; i think that&rsquo;s another post, though.</p>
