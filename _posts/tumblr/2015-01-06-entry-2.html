<p>#Entry 2<b><br/></b></p><p>6 Jan 2015</p><p>==========</p><p>lesson learned from day of reflection: one day isn&rsquo;t enough. i think i also need to go away to do it properly.</p><p>if i make it to 2016, i want to take a two-day weekend or block out one full day from sunup to sundown. i was also too easily distracted during the day and was too able to find things i needed to do to prepare for diving back into the stream of life. </p><p>it&rsquo;d be nice to go somewhere on friday night, probably solo, sleep there, wake up, review 2015 calendar, think about life and meaning, plan for 2016, sleep, return home the following morning. </p>
