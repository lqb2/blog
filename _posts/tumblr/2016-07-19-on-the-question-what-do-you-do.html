<p>what do you do? </p><p>&ldquo;what do you do?&rdquo; this question is like an invasive weed. it&rsquo;s everywhere and SO annoying. after asking for someone&rsquo;s name, it&rsquo;s usually one of the first questions that gets asked. </p><p>the question bothers me because it shows just how much we (middle-class americans) identify ourselves by our work. your job and social value are indicated by what you do to earn money. the worst part is that the question isn&rsquo;t as explicit as that, but everyone knows what it means. it actually has lots of potential as a broader question. and yet, i can count on two hands the number of times someone has answered that question without telling me what they do to earn money. </p><p>although i don&rsquo;t think identifying strongly with work as our primary identity has ever been a good idea (#industrialcapitalism), as our economy evolves, i think we absolutely have to get away from this pattern. </p><p>so, i&rsquo;m developing alternatives to this question. </p><p>i think i&rsquo;ll build a tool for it (<a href="https://quotesondesign.com/">probably something like this</a>). in the meantime, here are some of my favorites.</p><ul><li>what&rsquo;s your favorite way to spend time these days?</li><li>if you had one more hour to live, what would you do?</li><li>what are you dreaming about these days? </li><li>what&rsquo;s your story? [this question comes in 5, 10, 20, and entire-evening varieties]</li><li>if you had to die tomorrow, how would you choose to go and why?</li><li>are you a sprinter or marathoner? [<a href="http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/2017/01/08/2016-07-07-sprinters-and-marathoners/">this one came from a recent piece i wrote</a>]</li></ul><p>in general, i hate shallow conversation and small talk. so these questions are an attempt to get beyond those things. life is short. go deep or go home. </p>
