<p>listening to this podcast on dark matter and physics (<a href="https://onbeing.org/programs/lisa-randall-dark-matter-dinosaurs-and-extra-dimensions-sep2017/">this i think</a>). creativity isn&rsquo;t possible without constraints. reminded me of the video where a popcorn kernel popping was the analogy to the creative process. it takes ingredients in a container with applied pressure to make it work. </p><p>so this is my microblog. everyday. fewer than 200 words. 10 minutes or less (including editing, not including research). whatever is on my mind. public. (mostly) not fact checked. </p><p>go.</p>
