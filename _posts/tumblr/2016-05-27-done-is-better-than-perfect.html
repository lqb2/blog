<p>in the couple of years since finishing grad school, i&rsquo;ve had a lot of ideas (many of them in collaboration with several good friends). and, for better or worse, very few of those ideas have gotten off the ground (probably around 20%). this, to me, is a problem.<br/></p><p>having noticed this trend in myself, i&rsquo;m trying my best to put an end to it. i&rsquo;ve been inspired by <a href="http://jessicahische.is/aprocrastiworker">jessica hirsch</a> (via <a href="https://soundcloud.com/designmatters/jessica-hische">design matters</a>), @femmebot (of <a href="http://t.co/p0hQdFm9Hv">25x52.com</a>), the <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5864004/the-done-manifesto-lays-out-13-ground-rules-for-getting-to-done">done manifesto</a>, and some other folks who just put stuff out into the world. </p><p>they&rsquo;ve inspired me to adopt an mvp model for almost everything in my life. i stumbled upon the value of mvps, minimum viable products, from eric ries. his book, <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles">the lean startup</a>, and <a href="http://thenextweb.com/dd/2014/11/12/15-ways-test-minimum-viable-product/#gref">this specific list of mvp examples</a> really got me thinking about how helpful mvp thinking is. <br/></p><p>so now i&rsquo;m generalizing the techniques to my life. that has resulted in two specific pieces of advice that i give myself and others.<br/></p><ol><li>get going. this means using processes that work for you to get whatever it is done. <br/></li><li>done is better than perfect (lately popularized by sheryl sandberg in lean in). this means minimizing/removing any barriers that slow you down from getting going.</li></ol><p>so what does it look like irl? example: this blog. i have serious anxiety about writing. but, to get going, i just set up a tumblr because it was the easiest process for me (i set up tumblrs in my sleep). and then, to make sure that done was better than perfect, i set a constraint for myself that to just hit publish after writing for 10 minutes. that&rsquo;s it. (well, i also use hemingwayapp.com to write now and i don’t count research/link-hunting time in the 10 minutes, but whatever). anyway&hellip;</p><p>i&rsquo;m really starting to believe that an idea that&rsquo;s out in the world, imperfect as it may be, is better than one that just exists in your brain. and now i&rsquo;m getting a lot more things out into the world. </p><p>good stuff.</p>
