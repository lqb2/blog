<p><span style="font-size: 14px;">i wish i could remember who taught me this principle (maybe my friend, elias), but it&rsquo;s a good one. </span><br/></p><p>the example through which i learned about planning for 50% was related to crop planning. as a community, the principle was applied such that they needed to plan for only 50% crop success. this meant they planted or collected twice what was needed in order to be resilient (in case half of it failed). <br/></p><p>though many <a href="http://www.ciesin.org/docs/004-176a/004-176a.html">indigenous farming practices seem alien to industrial agriculture</a>, i can imagine forest gardens and integral shifting cultivation systems that follow this 50% rule.</p><p>planning for 50% builds in the potential to deal with the unexpected. in a sense, the practice embodies that fact that the only thing that can be consistently expected is the unexpected.</p><p>i dream of one day having fully embodied this practice in my personal work management system. i know it&rsquo;s not exactly how the principle was intended, but it seems like it could provide lots of value. <br/></p><p>for instance, i know that my brain has a daily decision-making limit [link]. and yet, i often plan my days out too ambitiously. this means that i rarely actually feel or believe that i accomplished enough in any given day. planning for 50% would make me drastically reduce what i plan to fit in any single day. this would both allow me to feel more successful about my days. <br/></p><p>i also think it would encourage me to be more rigorous about prioritizing my work tasks. i made this little <a href="http://lqb2sketches.tumblr.com/post/99314841380">daily planning tool</a> a couple of years back that probably would help with this (it’s just a digital version of something my friend, cameron, made), but i have since stopped using it. maybe i’ll restart that practice&hellip; <br/></p><p>and i think giving myself more flexibility during the day would allow me to respond to more unexpected tasks and opportunities without resenting them or the people that bring them (being a really good planner definitely has its downsides).</p><p>maybe i&rsquo;ll make embodying this practice part of my 2017 priorities.</p>
