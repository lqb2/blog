<p>one of the guys i mentor has been trying out some bits of my systems (which i talk about here [link to forthcoming post about pieces of my methodology]). sometimes, it seems like some things stick and other times, he’s feeling like it’s not working.<br/></p><p>he’s got the writing on the wall (literally) but sometimes the stuff just doesn’t stick. </p><p>on one hand, i’ve done lots of reading and i’ve integrated that into my life in a way that works for me. it will (probably) be different for him and everyone else, too. </p><p>on the other hand, i think the learning that i’ve done about how to apply this thinking is non-trivial. and i want to underscore the word learn, because it is just that: learning. and, this, unlike many things people our age have learned up until now, requires a different type of learning. </p><p>i’ve heard this referred to as ‘adult learning’ and, though i haven’t done much exploration of it, it seems pretty critical to thinking about how i (and other people) will learn this personal scheduling stuff.</p><p>hm!</p><p>found a quick primer <a href="http://elearningindustry.com/the-adult-learning-theory-andragogy-of-malcolm-knowles">here</a>. seems legit.</p>
