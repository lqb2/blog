<p>this morning i finished an <a href="http://www.onbeing.org/program/david-steindl-rast-anatomy-of-gratitude/8361">onbeing episode with david steindl-rast</a>. one somewhat random direction the conversation took was on the subject of anxiety.<br/></p><p>steindl-rast explained that the root of the word anxious has to do with the struggle of giving birth. it deals from what the mother and the child feel. <br/></p><p>however, he goes on to explain that anxiety itself isn&rsquo;t bad. it feels bad but getting through it creates new life and preserves old (mother and child). <br/></p><p>what is bad, though, is fear combined with anxiety. in the worst case, it causes death. i.e. when a mother or child is unable or too afraid to move through the discomfort of birth, the outcomes can be deadly for one or both. <br/></p><p>the trick is to embrace the anxiety while moving forward through the fear. <br/></p><p>this analogy carries through on so many levels, including racial anxiety. our nation and communities are racially anxious&hellip; but new birth is coming. <br/></p><p>it must&hellip; </p><p>right?</p>
