<p>earlier in 2016 i wrote about <a href="http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/2017/01/08/2016-10-07-why-i-dont-read-fiction/">why i don&rsquo;t read fiction</a>. i&rsquo;ve since changed my mind. that&rsquo;s allowed, right?<br/></p><p>i&rsquo;ve been influenced by several things:<br/></p><ol><li>working on <a href="http://www.the4thbox.com/">#the4thbox</a> (with danielle, felicia, and angus) as it relates to the political imagining we need to do collectively.</li><li>my friend erin&rsquo;s <a href="https://medium.com/@eringh/why-i-consume-fiction-f0883879b926">response</a> to my piece about why i don&rsquo;t read fiction (is this what public discourse looks like? lol)</li><li><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/octavia-butler-predicted-make-america-great-again_us_5776d9dce4b0416464100242">octavia butler predicting the rise of trump in parable of the sower</a> (h/t miriam mack!).</li><li>conversations with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cyndisuarez">cyndi suarez</a> about her interest and work in bringing gamification and play into social change spaces.</li><li>conversations with <a href="http://baluginspace.com/">kate balug</a> and her interest in utopia(s).<br/></li><li>grant williams&rsquo; fiction master&rsquo;s (masters? why can i never figure that out&hellip;) thesis.</li></ol><p>there are probably some other influences, too, but those seem like the most poignant ones. over thanksgiving break i read giovanni&rsquo;s room by james baldwin and i&rsquo;m still reeling from it. i&rsquo;ve started several others (mostly octavia butler) and now i&rsquo;m working towards holding an event on imagination in february within colab. <br/></p><p>bringing fiction back into my life seems like just another manifestation of how important play and imagination are. where will all this end up? i don&rsquo;t know, but i&rsquo;m going there anyways!</p><p>writing: 11:05<br/>spell-check, link-finding, &amp; formatting: 7:24<br/></p>
