<p>as i&rsquo;m reading this <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/97411.Letters_from_a_Stoic">book of letters from seneca</a>, i&rsquo;ve realized some things. </p><ol><li>there is so much good and simple stuff here that i could write a post per letter (sometimes more). </li><li>there are recurring themes and that it might serve me to wrap thematic insights together. </li><li>while the stuff in here is good, i really want to get back to reading more strategy stuff (even though i&rsquo;m increasingly understanding how important internal personal work is for strategy) and also more work by people in oppressed groups (black, indigenous, queer &amp; trans, women, colonized, etc.).<br/></li></ol><p>all that aside, this post is about two letters that all discuss the importance of staying in place and focusing. <br/></p><p>the first, <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_2">letter ii</a>, is about focusing. on developing strong friendships and how &ldquo;people who spend their whole life travelling abroad end up having plenty of places where they can find hospitality but no real friendships&rdquo; and how reading a single author to learn deeply is more important than reading one book by every one and learning broadly.<br/></p><p>the second, <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_28">letter xxviii</a>, is also about how traveling doesn&rsquo;t necessarily solve one&rsquo;s woes. it basically says that sometimes people who want to travel think it will be a cure for their discontent, but what they&rsquo;re actually running from is internal. once one figures out how to deal with one&rsquo;s internal problems, traveling is nice but everything needed can be found wherever you are.</p><p>all of those points are basically made without saying much more, but it definitely is adding fuel to my &ldquo;stay in boston&rdquo; fire.</p><p>ps - so great that i found <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius">all seneca&rsquo;s letters online</a>!</p><p>writing: 11:50<br/>spell-check, link-finding, &amp; formatting: 5:42<br/></p>
