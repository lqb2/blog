<p>over the months it took to <a href="http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/2017/01/08/2016-09-03-how-my-masters-thesis-changed-my-life/">write my masters thesis</a>, i discovered the power of airplane mode. it has totally changed my life and how i engage with my phone and my computer, too.<br/></p><p>while trying to do <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com">pomodoros</a>Â (a method of creating focus), i discovered that, like many people, i have developed an addiction to checking my phone. regardless of whether i need to be checking it for a specific reason or not, i check it several times an hour. this, of course, means that whenever something does show up, i engage with it.</p><p>unfortunately, interruptions are the death knell of focus (i recently started reading a book on focus; i&rsquo;m sure i&rsquo;ll be writing about that soon). despite what people say about multi-tasking, <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/270267">it is still generally less effective than bursts of intense, specifically directed focus</a>. </p><p>i discovered that airplane mode really helped me (made it out of my power) to not check my phone incessantly. one big thing i&rsquo;ve learned on this productivity journey is that highly successful people use as little self-control as possible by <a href="http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/2017/01/08/2016-07-17-turns-out-high-functioning-people-dont-rely-much/">building habits and routines that allow them to make progress on their goals without thinking about it</a>. <br/></p><p>of course, i could have turned off airplane mode when i wanted to check my phone in the middle of a focus session. but i found that having it on created just enough barrier to allow me to not. </p><p>eventually, i found that the best way to focus was to:</p><ol><li>put my phone completely away so that even alarms and reminders didn&rsquo;t distract me, <br/></li><li>take imessage/messages (apple&rsquo;s desktop app that allows text messaging) off my computer, and <br/></li><li>turn off my internet. this internet disconnect thing is what lead to me realizing that i should write first and do research before or after writing. most days i just insert a placeholder and then return to it during editing. example: yesterday, i read an article, [FIND HYPERLINK AND NAME OF ARTICLE], and it totally changed my mind about ham sandwiches.</li></ol><p>all this ubiquitous computing and technology has some pretty incredible benefit to society, but we also need to learn how to not let it own us. i think learning how to disconnect periodically is really important.</p><p>ps - my friend, casper, practices a technology sabbath based on <a href="http://www.sabbathmanifesto.org/">this methodology</a>&hellip; i&rsquo;m not there yet, but i think it&rsquo;s going to be a practice i start with in 2017.</p>
