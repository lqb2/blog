<p>where and with whom i grew up is a tough thing for me. both of my parents grew up pretty poor. i have no shame about that and i don&rsquo;t think they do either (though i could be wrong; i should ask). but it seemed clear to me growing up that they made every effort they could to put my brother and i on fast tracks to success. we lived in middle-class neighborhoods and even owned a pretty large 3- or 4-bedroom house near the end of my high school days. i still remember our living room being large enough that i could play hacky sack with a friend with no problem.<br/></p><p>all that to say, i grew up in pretty white neighborhoods with well resourced, &ldquo;good schools.&rdquo; i was often one or two or three black students in my class or grade level. i read a lot, was good at math, did martial arts, and played violin and trombone. i was little and a nerd. </p><p> i say all this to say, i didn&rsquo;t really fit in. i was a floater (as are many of the people i associate with now, interesting trend&hellip;). i had friends at all the lunch tables because i didn&rsquo;t really feel that comfortable identifying with any single group all the time. i was too white for most of the black kids (&ldquo;well-spoken,&rdquo; &ldquo;smart,&rdquo; the usual coded supremacist language targeted at nonwhite young people to make them realize that they can&rsquo;t be whatever they are AND things characterists that belong to white people), too little for the sports kids (tae kwon do doesn&rsquo;t count as a real sport), and too nerdy for the cool kids (why did i make such a point of reading all the books on our classroom reading lists?).</p><p>i can look at all this stuff now through an oppression analysis and it all makes sense. but those early years of developing a strong relationship with my family and physical home didn&rsquo;t really happen for me. we also didn&rsquo;t visit my parent&rsquo;s families that often. maybe a couple of times a year and i remember not having fun most of the time (most of my extended family still lives around where my parents grew up). <br/></p><p>it’s also really hard to be home for me because my dad is a pastor and the black church is <b>still</b> mostly homophobic. case in point: this happened literally days ago: <a href="http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2017/01/from-the-pulpit-to-the-people-kim-burrell-homosexuality-and-the-black-church/">kim burrell goes on a pulpit tirade against homosexuality</a>.</p><p>as a result, i have very weak ties to physical home and family and left florida as soon as possible (freshman year of college). i shipped off to boston, oh oh oh&hellip;</p><p>but now, largely as a result of my deepening analysis, i know that i need to connect to my family and my history/past. my work through infinite growth has also reminded me that family can be a mutually beneficial resource if you put the work in. i didn&rsquo;t do that when i was young, but it&rsquo;s never too late. </p><p>anyways, all of this is a lead up to say that when i went home for this past winter break, i heard some things from my dad and aunt and grandma that remind me that who i am is shaped by people in my family, even if i&rsquo;m unaware of it.</p><p>examples:</p><ul><li>i whistle a lot (and pretty well). when whistling around my dad&rsquo;s house, he said, &ldquo;wow boy, you whistle just like your grandma ruth. she loved to whistle.&rdquo; i never wished my grandma was still alive more than that moment. i wonder if i got that from her during the days we spent with her when i was young.</li><li>i love eating double-stuf oreos before bed. one night before bed while standing in the kitchen, i watched my dad pull down a package of golden oreos and dunk some in water (he&rsquo;s lactose-intolerant) before bed. </li><li>i stay busy and i travel a lot. mama brown (my play grandma) said on the phone to me, &ldquo;dang you and yo daddy are just alike. can&rsquo;t nobody hold y'all down.&rdquo;</li><li>i didn&rsquo;t drink til i was 21 but now i drink maybe 4 drinks a week. i had forgotten this (even though it shaped why i didn&rsquo;t drink til i was 21), but my dad has two siblings who died in alcohol-related incidents. the more brutal of the two cases was my uncle. he was drunk one night, picked a bar fight with the wrong people, was followed out of the bar by them, and then beaten up and thrown onto some railroad tracks to be hit by a train. one of my dad&rsquo;s other brothers had to i.d. the body and hasn&rsquo;t really been the same since. </li></ul><p>so yea. family and home are tough for me, but i think i need to change that. when and how quickly i don&rsquo;t know, but i&rsquo;ll figure that out as it goes.</p><p>ps - this is the most public i&rsquo;ve been about this ever. i hope it doesn&rsquo;t blow up in my face or backfire somehow. i also didn&rsquo;t really go back and edit this one at all (need to get going to work!). hopefully it&rsquo;s coherent. or not. whatever. done better than perfect.</p><p>writing: 23:00<br/>​spell-check, link-finding, &amp;
