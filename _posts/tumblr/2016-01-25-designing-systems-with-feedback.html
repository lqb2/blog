<p>i think what i do well is design systems with feedback. i feel pretty good at creating an initial solution to a problem that includes room for feedback so it can improve over time.Â <br/></p><p>now all that said, this process isn&rsquo;t new by any means. defining just enough structure so an idea can get off the ground and then improve over time is the core of design-thinking, lean product development and probably more. all which i&rsquo;ve been significantly influenced by. <br/></p><p>so what i bring (i think) is personal level implementation. i&rsquo;ve created a system for managing my own calendar that has evolved over the past year into a comprehensive time management protocol. it is by no means perfect but it keeps me feeling sane, making progress, and has clear indicators built in to trigger re-evaluation when necessary. <br/></p><p>i&rsquo;m sharing the lessons i&rsquo;ve learned with one of the guys i mentor and he&rsquo;s said it&rsquo;s been illuminating. in 2016, i&rsquo;m learning a lot about where my tools and systems come from and how they might apply or not to someone else. more learning to come soon. </p>
