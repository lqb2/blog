<p>when walls go up<br/>it is hard to bring them down. <br/>even when you want to. </p><p>berlin.</p><p>the media is already normalizing the hate speech.<br/>the wall: reasonable.<br/>banning muslims: reasonable.<br/>extreme vetting: reasonable.<br/>defunding sanctuaries: reasonable.</p><p>my hometown crew is team trump.<br/>so i hear.<br/>speechless. <br/></p><p>impressive, really.<br/>love your neighbor.<br/>build a wall between you and them.<br/>lose no sleep. <br/>impressive.</p><p>not my home. </p><p>where are the walls in us?<br/>what are the walls in us?<br/>each of us. <br/>all of us.<br/>us.</p><p>what are they made of?<br/>fear? distance? dislike? disbelief?</p><p>pain. </p><p>what signals are we sending our children?<br/>do not welcome.<br/>they are not welcome. <br/>they must leave. <br/>they are hurting us.</p><p>ignore that we bomb their hometowns.<br/>that we say ‘come’ with billboards and paychecks.<br/></p><p>but how did we get here?<br/>different paths. <br/>many forced.<br/>many chosen.<br/></p><p>but now, we are here.<br/>and they cannot be.<br/></p><p>so we kick them out.<br/>and watch. <br/></p><p>as we destroy ourselves from the inside.</p>
