<p>today i met up with one of my favorite fraternity brothers. we talked about a lot, but one of the topics was about lessons learned from living together.</p><p>he said this, &ldquo;if there&rsquo;s one thing i learned from living in the [fraternity] house it was how to live and function with people who had fundamentally different world views than me. i might have major disagreements with them, but because we live in the same place, we still figured out how to work together.&rdquo;</p><p>his statement reminds me of several conversations we&rsquo;re having at work right now. one of them is the belief that people, in spite of their diffrences, can come together and collectively make the world a better place for all of us (we call this big democracy). the other is a question i&rsquo;ve been holding about our work: &ldquo;how close do two or more people need to be in order to be honest about their beliefs but still keep moving forward together? how much do i need to know someone else in order to genuinely respect them and, if we disagree, still keep working them towards some goal we do share?&rdquo;</p><p>in the age of the internet and ever-polarizing politics, it&rsquo;s easier than ever to seclude oneself from dissenting opinions. this can look like: defriending/unfollowing people who disagree with you, only following/friending people who agree with you, only consuming news media that, generally, agrees with your point of view, etc.<br/></p><p>but that, honestly, just doesn&rsquo;t seem like a legitimate pathway forward.</p>
