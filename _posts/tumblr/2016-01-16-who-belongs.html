<p>today, i&rsquo;m wondering about how to expand our (america&rsquo;s) understanding of who belongs.</p><p>i&rsquo;m getting ready to write a blog post for mlk jr day and the focus will be his letter from a birmingham jail. this letter means a lot to me because of . </p><p>&ldquo;I cannot sit idly by in Atlanta and not be concerned about what happens in Birmingham. Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly. Never again can we afford to live with the narrow, provincial &quot;outside agitator&rdquo; idea. Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.&ldquo; - Letter from a Birmingham Jail, 16 april 1963</p><p>the connection between this analogy and john a. powell&rsquo;s ideas about belonging seems particularly critical to me right now. as i think about donald trump&rsquo;s bid for the presidency, i wonder how to encourage people against (and for) him to see each other. he is incredible at finding a single or group of people to victimize. how can belonging counter that? how can our shared identities help bind us even as we are different? </p>
