<p>this is a little trick i learned from paul graham’s post: <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">maker’s schedule vs manager’s schedule</a>. i reference this post atdt. it&rsquo;s been incredibly helpful, though it does have its limits.<br/></p><p>the trick is very simple: if you have one meeting already scheduled on a day and another comes up, schedule it the minimum amount of time before the next meeting so that it can&rsquo;t run long. example: i already have a meeting at 3p, but someone else wants to meet me that same day. if i know that 2nd meeting needs about 60 minutes, i will schedule it for 145p and let the person know that i need to be at 3p meeting.</p><p>this works for me for a bunch of reasons:</p><p>impromptu meetings are almost never planned well. minimizing the time they take out of my schedule is critical. not being planned well doesn&rsquo;t mean it won&rsquo;t go well, but there is a strong correlation in my experience.</p><p>stacking meetings also allows me to optimize my <a href="http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/2017/01/08/2016-07-28-how-to-decide-what-to-do-in-a-particular-moment/">&ldquo;heavy-thinking&rdquo; time</a> while still doing the meetings i need to. i started doing this in grad school. i would cram my meetings all onto the same days as my classes so that i had long chunks of free time to write my thesis. this can also be thought about through the <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">maker time vs manager time</a> frame. i know that, at least for me, the more maker time (long, uninterrupted blocks of time) i have, the better i feel. making progress makes me feel productive and feeling productive feels great. meetings, for better or worse, rarely feel productive. even the best ones don&rsquo;t and i think that&rsquo;s ok. working in meetings is somewhat futile i think because most &ldquo;work&rdquo; can&rsquo;t actually be done in meetings.</p><p>so what are the limits? </p><p>well, for one, some meetings run long because they actually need to. sometimes a group gets into a flow around something. in that circumstance, breaking the flow can be less net productive than continuing to go and rearranging the commitments the group didn&rsquo;t deliver on. if you&rsquo;ve boxed yourself in, you create the danger of not giving something the time it needs. </p><p>another limit is that if you need follow up time from the first meeting or prep time for the next meeting, stacked meetings hinder that. </p><p>ok. that&rsquo;s all i got for me. stacking meetings is a great strategy for keep your schedule clear. but only to a point. </p><p>ps - over time, i&rsquo;ve developed a really good intuition of which types of meetings have a tendency to run long or need prep time and so i can stack accordingly. </p>
