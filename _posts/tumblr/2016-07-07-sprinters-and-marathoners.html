<p>the latest two episodes of <a href="http://www.debbiemillman.com/designmatters/">design matters</a> are really getting my thinking flowing. i&rsquo;ve got four posts drafted already and there will probably be more than that. but, as always, there&rsquo;s nothing to do except start so here&rsquo;s the first. <br/></p><p>this post is mostly about this quote from the hilariously self-referential gretchen rubin: &ldquo;there are two types of people in the world: people who separate the world into two types of people and people who don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>one of these breakdowns gretchen mentions in <a href="https://soundcloud.com/designmatters/design-matters-with-debbie-millman-gretchen-rubin">her interview</a> is sprinters and marathoners. this totally matches my understanding of people in the world. <br/></p><p>i consider myself a marathoner. though there&rsquo;s always room for improvement, i definitely have the most developed skills around thinking long-term. my whole interest in systems thinking evolved from my recognition that short-term assessment of work often misses big picture patterns that undermine short-term gains. iâ€™m also always thinking about how to implement lightweight (meaning easy, quick, non-time-consuming) protocols and practices that create and accumulate value over time. </p><p>my friend ross, on the other hand, is definitely a sprinter. he wakes up with SO much energy and loves to dive headfirst into his work. </p><p>of course, using ourselves as examples, each of us can operate in both modes. i know very well how to define a scope of work for a short amount of time and execute on it. ross knows how to think about, envision, and build long-term work. but at the end of the day, we make a good pair because we each naturally default to opposite lanes in gretchen&rsquo;s running metaphor. we balance each other out and also compliment each other&rsquo;s thinking. but i disgress&hellip;</p><p>gretchen&rsquo;s breakdown of sprinters versus marathoners is super helpful. it&rsquo;s something i can imagine myself asking in place of the &lsquo;what do you do?&rsquo; question [future blog post about my hatred of that question coming soon]. <br/></p><p>&ldquo;in life, are you a sprinter or a marathoner? how do you know?&rdquo;</p>
