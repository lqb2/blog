<p>part 1 review: in order to be maximally productive, you should <a href="http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/2017/01/08/2016-07-28-how-to-decide-what-to-do-in-a-particular-moment/">use the following four criteria to determine what to do at any given moment in time</a>:<br/></p><ol><li>context</li><li>time available</li><li>energy available</li><li>priority</li></ol><p>how do the four criteria function together? here&rsquo;s a little narrative that describes a few different ways that the four criteria work for me. this is internal monologue.</p><p><b>context</b></p><p>&ldquo;ok. where am i? at work. great. i should only focus on things i can do while i&rsquo;m physically at the office. i should also try to do things i want to keep dissociated from my home space. this means stuff that i could do here but could also do at home should wait.&rdquo;</p><p><b>time available</b></p><p>&ldquo;what time is it? 715a. my first meeting of the day isn&rsquo;t until 11a which means i have almost four hours of uninterrupted work time. awesome! this seems like a good opportunity to get into flow [link to post about flow and creativity]. that means i shouldn&rsquo;t let myself break up this time block into tiny chunks by having random convos with my co-workers, checking my email, or texting. let me find a quiet room where i can work without interruptions, put my phone on airplane-mode, and close down my email client.&rdquo;</p><p><b>energy available</b></p><p>&ldquo;ok, so it&rsquo;s 415p and i have a really important deliverable due tomorrow at noon. that said, only have 30 minutes until my shuttle leaves and i&rsquo;m mentally exhausted from my morning work session and the two afternoon meetings i attended. i should do something that needs to get done, but isn&rsquo;t going to take a lot of mental energy.&rdquo;</p><p><b>priority</b></p><p>&ldquo;so in this 30 minute block of time before i leave the office, i could check my email or i could file my expense reports. my expense reports aren&rsquo;t due until next week. i&rsquo;m also waiting on an important message from a contractor. i should check my email and save my expenses for later. maybe if i finish my email, i could squeeze in the expense reporting. but if not, eventually, the expense reporting will be higher priority (more urgent) than anything else and it&rsquo;ll get done then.&rdquo;</p><p><br/></p><p>it takes time to go through these four criteria at any given moment. i’ve found that taking the time results in significantly more productive days. that means i actually achieve my goals and consequently build confidence (because it feels great to set a goal and then achieve it). this positive feedback cycle simply cannot be underestimated. </p>
