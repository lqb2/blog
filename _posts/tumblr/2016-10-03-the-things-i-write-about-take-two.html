<p>yesterday, spencer and i had a really long, wandering, good conversation about many things. one of them was me writing a book and it might be about. this is my take on spencer&rsquo;s take of what my book could be about.<br/></p><p>what are the cultural implications of making and consuming differently?</p><p>i think a lot about objects: what they are made of, where they come from, who they come from, how long they last, what they mean to us (individually, collectively, societally). <br/></p><p>this manifests in my daily life on a number of practical planes. i try to consume as little as possible (recycling is nice, but most of the waste our society produces is upstream, says my friend <a href="http://www.urbanmetabolism.org/the-team/jonathan-s-krones/">jonathan krones, who studies waste and urban metabolism</a>). </p><p>that has two implications. first, because i try to minimize my throughput, i think a lot about what things i do consume. and by consume i mean, purchase, use, and discard (hopefully in circular ways, but not always). second, it means i try to pick things that have high utility. utility in this context is defined by how much i like the thing (shoutout to <a href="http://tidyingup.com/">marie kondo</a>), how long it&rsquo;ll last, how often i&rsquo;ll use it, how much it fits into my other possessions, and how durable it be for someone else once i no longer need it.</p><p>these two things involve a lot of thinking; thinking through what it means to use objects and what that means for consumption. </p><p>this, i imagine, will lead very quickly to differences between my generation and my parents&rsquo; generation. the question there will be: in a practical and technological sense, what are the implications of us not wanting the things that our parents wanted/created? my parents&rsquo; generation created mass consumption, consumerism, et cetera. <br/></p><p>what, then, are the cultural impacts of wanting different things? as spencer put it, &ldquo;lots of people think about the tools themselves but not the cultural impact of the tools.&rdquo; this rings true to me, particularly as i think about about how the institutions that facilitate (dominate?) our society seem increasingly out of touch&hellip; but not from lack of trying. they just were built for a different era with different constraints and desired outcomes.<br/></p><p>so, what are the cultural implications of making differently and consuming differently? i missed the local implications of this, but i guess thatâ€™s what the book is for?</p>
