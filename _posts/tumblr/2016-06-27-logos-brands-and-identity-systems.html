<p>two recent(ish) episodes of <a href="http://www.obsessedshow.com/#design-podcast">obsessed with design</a> have me thinking a lot about logos, brands, and identity. i wrote a bit ago about my thoughts on <a href="http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/2017/01/08/2016-06-11-branding-the-aesthetic-manifestation-of-systems/">branding as the aesthetic manifestation of systems thinking</a>. the obsessed with design interviews with <a href="http://www.obsessedshow.com/episodes/dlklzx4pw0tgn02u4mflwkpbc64lma">paula scher</a> and <a href="http://www.obsessedshow.com/episodes/prescott-perez-fox">prescott perez-fox </a>have deepened my thinking.<br/></p><p>the following details from prescott perez-fox interview really stuck out to me. basically, he says that a logo on its own might be nice, but it&rsquo;s more or less irrelevant if it&rsquo;s not integrated across the brand of an identity.</p><p>heavy paraphrased thoughts from the prescott perez-fox episode: &ldquo;a single logo might be pretty but without a system, it&rsquo;s basically just clip art. without the identity system, we don&rsquo;t know if the client used it or if it successfully carried meaning across the brand / identity. a much more impressive thing is a simple logo with amazing system application. for example, h&amp;r block is just a green square but when you see it applied everywhere in ways that make sense, it&rsquo;s awesome.&rdquo;</p><p>paula scher&rsquo;s interview landed this particular point for me: identities are living, breathing things. the strength of an identity isn&rsquo;t in the mockups, it&rsquo;s in the world.</p><p>heavy paraphrased thoughts from the paula scher episode: &ldquo;identities can never be judged at the moment they&rsquo;re created. identity systems need time to live in the public. it takes a period of time for the public to digest an identity and also for the identity to have time to correct itself.&rdquo;</p><p>the deeper i get into brand-thinking, the more i&rsquo;m beginning to value the work of identity. it&rsquo;s a complicated, but it seems the most talented designers strike a balance between predefined elements and guidelines within which future artists and designers can create.</p><p>supa cool.</p><p>shoutout to <a href="http://www.joshmiles.com/#intro">josh miles</a> and obsessed with design; such an awesome show. </p>
