<p>in several areas of my life right now, having a clear communication hierarchy has been great. and by communication hierarchy i basically mean a chain of command that determines how to communicate with someone based on the urgency of the message.<br/></p><p>this all started because people kept (and still do) apologize to me for responding to my text messages days later. i couldn&rsquo;t figure it out. to me, the whole point of texting is to allow asynchronous communication. and the value of asynchronous communication is that people can respond when it&rsquo;s convenient. </p><p>this is in stark contrast to face-to-face communication. to respond to a comment days after someone said it to you in person would be rude. to do the same with a text, in my opinion, is not. that&rsquo;s exactly how it&rsquo;s supposed to work. </p><p>my personal, friends &amp; family communication hierarchy looks like:</p><ol><li>face-to-face convo</li><li>phone call</li><li>text</li><li>slack</li><li>tweet</li><li>email</li><li>physical mail</li></ol><p>my work hierarchy looks like:</p><ol><li>face-to-face</li><li>slack</li><li>email<br/></li><li>phone call</li></ol><p>now, it&rsquo;s important to note that context is key. at work, maybe email has a really high place in the hierarchy and needs to be responded to immediately (honestly, i think that&rsquo;s pretty destructive, but i know it happens in some work cultures). but for your friends and family, maybe phone calls have higher ranks than email. </p><p>and in some contexts, some tools aren’t or shouldn’t be used at all. for example, i try really hard to keep work conversation out of my text messages. when i don’t want to be working, i don’t want people to be able to or to have the expectation that they can text me to get me to respond to work matters. ew.</p><p>the point is, in whatever context you&rsquo;re in, having a clear shared understanding of the ways to get in touch with someone based on urgency of request is important. and what do you do when an important message hasn&rsquo;t been responded to via one method? move up the ladder and try another. and on and on until you get in touch. </p><p>but if you communicate with someone via top of the hierarchy tools for unimportant messages, you&rsquo;ll create a sense of resistance and then itll be increasingly difficult over time to get in touch with them.</p>
