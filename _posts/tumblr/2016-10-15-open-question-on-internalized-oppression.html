<p>what do you do when someone who has <a href="http://www.allisonj.org/non-profit-work/internalized-oppression-and-its-impact-on-social-change/">internalized oppression</a> says something that is oppressive to their own group?Â <br/></p><p>last week i was talking to a friend (woman) who called her boss a bitch. now, i fully believe that gendered derogatory terms are sexist and never to be used. had my friend identified as a man, i would have had no problem calling out that behavior. however, given that this friend was a woman (member of oppressed group) and i am man (member of oppressor group), i really wasn&rsquo;t sure what to do. can someone in an oppressor group address oppression in the corresponding oppressed group? </p><p>this situation has presented itself a number of times. a different friend called her boyfriend a pussy because of his low work ethic. a third friend, who identifies as half-black (but still black), told me i was unqualified for something because i was a dark-skinned nigger. <br/></p><p>how does one intervene in those moments?</p>
