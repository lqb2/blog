<p>i’ve been binging on podcasts about race. one of these is intersectionality by jamil smith.<br/></p><p><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/123153/intersection-episode-7-janet-mock-contains-multitudes">episode 7 is an interview with janet mock</a>, a journalist who happens to be trans. somewhere near the middle of the show, jamil asked janet, “how does it feel to be a spokesperson?” she responded that it sucks to only get asked questions about identity. she wished that she was asked more about what she&rsquo;s trained at doing: journalism and storytelling. <br/></p><p>and yet, for the rest of the show, jamil asked questions exclusively dealing with her identity as either trans, black, a woman, some combination of those things, or all of them at once.<br/></p><p>that’s weird, right?<br/></p><p>but janet herself explained that she&rsquo;s using her voice now as activist. and if an activist isn&rsquo;t a spokesperson, i don&rsquo;t know what is. </p><p>so what to do? </p>
