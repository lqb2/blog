<p>below is one of my favorite buckminster fuller quotes:<br/></p><blockquote><p>“To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.”</p></blockquote><p>the other day, i was explaining it to a friend (can&rsquo;t remember who anymore). that friend basically said that that quote is unrealistic for non-technological systems. i think my friend&rsquo;s argument was that (a) fuller was a techno-positivist, and (b) this quote only really applies to technological change because human systems are too messy for change to happen so simply.</p><p>i understand that technology systems are less constrained by human complexity. and still i think the quote is applicable.</p><p>it seems i&rsquo;m not alone. below is an excerpt from <a href="https://shift.newco.co/max-ventilla-of-altschool-the-full-shift-dialogs-transcript-677f9cdf9313">an interview</a> with max ventilla (co-?)founder of <a href="https://www.altschool.com/">AltSchool</a>.<br/></p><blockquote><p>Max Ventilla: AltSchool’s mission is to enable all children to achieve their full potential.</p><p>Interviewer: Isn’t that the mission of the public school system?</p><p>Max: I’d say the mission of a public school system is to allow those children to achieve their full potential.</p><p>Interviewer: What’s the difference?</p><p>Max: You need to create a network. You need to have a network effect where people are flocking to a new ecosystem that’s getting better and better, not because they’re altruistic, but because it’s the best.</p></blockquote><p>of course, it&rsquo;s much too soon to know if altschool will actually work. regardless, that last line i think could prove itself outside of technology fields as well. i know there is historical data that disproves this (example: gun control), but i still believe it’s possible. given the right information and the right motivation, i genuinely believe that people will flee failing systems for ones that function differently and just really are better.</p><p>one can dream, eh?</p>
