<p>this year, i&rsquo;ve been thinking and learning a lot about friendship. i made an intentional choice to have a group of people i consider really close (best?) friends, a group of people i consider close friends, and then everyone else. i wrote a bit about why <a href="http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/2017/01/08/2016-09-21-turns-out-you-cant-be-good-friends-with-everyone/">over here</a>, but the practice is continually teaching me.<br/></p><p>i now realize (believe?) that having regular time with close friends is a necessity; not optional. spending time with them gives me energy and that makes the rest of life easier and better. how? some reasons:</p><h2>they teach me new things</h2><p>the people i choose to keep close are some of the smartest, most passionate people i know. john rohn says that <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/jim-rohn-youre-the-average-of-the-five-people-you-spend-the-most-time-with-2012-7">we&rsquo;re composites of the five people we spend the most time with</a> and so i want the people who are influencing and shaping me to be people who inspire me. these friends often teach me things they know that i don&rsquo;t because we come from different places. this makes moving through the rest of my life make more sense because i can draw on experience other than my own. i like to think the teaching and learning goes both ways, too.</p><h2>i learn about myself</h2><p>i&rsquo;m an external processor and so i actually learn what i think in explaining it to someone else. and, yes, this can happen with people i know less well, but it&rsquo;s different with someone who knows you well. people who know your whole story can make connections across parts of your life that you never had. it&rsquo;s harder for strangers to do that, though it is possible. close friends can also tell you tough things (because you have built up a foundation of trust) that you couldn&rsquo;t hear from someone else.</p><h2>we share resources</h2><p>my close friends and tend to share resources in a different way than i do with other people. these obviously aren&rsquo;t hard and fast rules, but i think resources flow more freely because we know we see each other often. sometimes that just means eating food together without worrying about who&rsquo;s paying what. other times i means sending each other links and articles that are relevant to a degree that only a close friend would know. also, when a close friend tells me that i should meet someone, i know that that&rsquo;s a really important connection to make; some of those connections have been game changers for me in terms of career and life trajectory. </p><p>so yes. close friend hangout time. not optional. </p>
