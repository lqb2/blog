<p>i&rsquo;ve thought a lot about (and even done <a href="http://lqb2.co/blog/2016/07/19/on-the-question-what-do-you-do/">some writing about</a>) alternatives to the &lsquo;what do you do&rsquo; question. some of that is because it&rsquo;s just annoying and boring to repeatedly answer the same question at social gatherings. some of it is because i think it&rsquo;s in the small, but ubiquitous things that culture shifts. i have a theory that if everyone started asking 'what are you dreaming about these days?&rsquo; instead of 'what do you do?&rsquo; we&rsquo;d see a culture shift over time away from our identities defined by our work.<br/></p><p>in the past week, i&rsquo;ve definitely noticed and experienced resistance to the standard question: &ldquo;how are you?&rdquo; although, as a general practice, i try to be honest when i answer this question, lately i&rsquo;ve been feeling real tired of answering it. i&rsquo;ve also heard people take the question back after they&rsquo;ve answered it and i&rsquo;ve heard people say &ldquo;i don&rsquo;t really want to talk about how i&rsquo;m doing.&rdquo; </p><p>i do actually think it&rsquo;s really important to know how each other is doing, but i also think that this is a moment for culture shifting (even if just at a small scale/geography) intervention. what can we ask each other that moves us in the direction we want to be headed? some ones i&rsquo;m going to test out today:</p><ul><li>what are you listening to that&rsquo;s keeping you going right now?</li><li>what (if anything) makes you hopeful in this moment?</li><li>what are you doing to resist and/or fight?</li></ul><p>definitely curious about other people&rsquo;s thoughts on this! </p>
