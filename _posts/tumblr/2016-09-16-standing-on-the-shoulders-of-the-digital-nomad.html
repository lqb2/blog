<p>sometime last week my friend, jason, sent me this article: <a href="http://qz.com/775751/digital-nomad-problems-nomadlist-and-remoteok-founder-pieter-levels-explains-why-he-has-quit-the-nomadic-lifestyle/">Ditching the office to work in paradise as a “digital nomad” has a hidden dark side</a>.</p><p>it seems like the overall thrust of the article is this: the digital nomad lifestyle is actually not that great.<br/></p><p>ross, my jungle partner, and i think about digital nomad lifestyle (it fits into what ross calls the #5to9) a lot. we&rsquo;re both actually really excited to try it out/we’re already doing it. </p><p>i think maybe the above article is an example of first wave digital nomadism and what we’re doing/thinking about is part of the second wave. i think the following factors/thoughts are some of the distinctions:<br/></p><ul><li><b>endless vacation is not the goal</b> (it&rsquo;s also a myth and actually a terrible thing); seeing the world and making your work better is A goal.</li><li><b>travel in itself is not valuable.</b> it’s all about what you learn and then do with the lessons that is valuable.</li><li><b>community and relationships matter.</b> travel is not a replacement for meaningful, long-term relationships (family, friends, lovers) and the benefits (and downsides) of community.<br/></li><li><b>traveling the world may feel urgent and important in one phase of life and totally uninteresting in another.</b> one might want it in varying degrees at different points in time. i have many management consulting friends who would do anything for three months at home. i also have other friends would do anything to quit their jobs and travel for a year. as with most things, there is a balance, the balance changes over time, and the real highest value happens when people have the flexibility and ability to live life how they want at any given time.</li></ul><p>so basically, the first wave of digital nomads did a lot of testing. maybe we&rsquo;re a part of round two. </p><p>ps - there&rsquo;s a particular phrase that floats around the queer world that seems apt here. &ldquo;partnered/married but with a long chain&hellip;&rdquo; do with that what you will. ;)</p>
