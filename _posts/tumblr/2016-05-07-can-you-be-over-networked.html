<p>i am a person who identifies (and has been identified by others) as a <a href="http://gladwell.com/are-you-a-connector/">connector</a>. so it&rsquo;s from that stance that i wonder if it’s possible to be over-networked. <br/></p><p>i&rsquo;ve been thinking about this a lot lately for two reasons. <br/></p><p>first, i keep hearing about the limits of human connection. there&rsquo;s some interesting, research (mostly coming from dunbar’s number research in the 1990s) about how the human brain can only meaningfully hold a certain number of people. after about 200 people, our brains begin to function worse when it comes to retaining information related to those people. so at a certain point, this means we actually can’t “know” more people. or at least, not well&hellip;</p><p>second, i notice in myself a diminishing desire to go to &lsquo;networking&rsquo; style events. well, i actually never liked events with that explicitly language, but still&hellip; i find myself resisting events with large amounts of new people and focusing on ones with more (or all) people i already know. </p><p>given those things i&rsquo;m starting to wonder if (in this digital age of social networks) being over-networked is a genuine possibility. i imagine at a certain point (maybe size of network), there must be a tradeoff between the time spent building a network versus time spent strengthening your existing network and/or utilizing it to get things done. <br/></p><p>i think being over-networked might show up in a few different ways. the two that first come to mind are:</p><ol><li>people who are “bad” at names are often super connected. (note: i only have anecdotal evidence about this).</li><li>people (myself included) forget important or key details about people what we genuinely care about. consequently, there is now a small market of apps built specifically to help us remember people we meet. (<a href="http://namesharkapp.com/">example 1</a>, <a href="http://namerick.com/about-namerick.html">example 2</a>, <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2888976/bad-with-names-2-android-apps-try-to-help.html">example 3</a>) weird, eh?</li></ol><p>anyway, i&rsquo;m still not sure if being over-networked is a real thing. either way, i&rsquo;m keeping my eyes open for other signs of this phenomenon in my life and in others. sure, i think some people really are meant to connectors; that&rsquo;s the passion and value they bring into the world. however, i think more of us have networks that are untapped and just oozing with potential. i&rsquo;m becoming increasingly interested in figuring out how to mobilize the potential for good.</p>
