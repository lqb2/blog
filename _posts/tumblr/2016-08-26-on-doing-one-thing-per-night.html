<p>so another <a href="http://lqb2writes.tumblr.com/tagged/personal-practice">personal practice</a> i&rsquo;ve developed is only committing to one event/engagement per evening.<br/></p><p>in different phases of life, i&rsquo;ve found myself setting up so many social engagements with people. it was the most intense in grad school, but it&rsquo;s happened in other phases, too. all too often a weeknight would look like this: after class or work, i would have drinks with a friend during happy hour; then i&rsquo;d leave and meet up with a different friend for dinner; sometimes i&rsquo;d even meet up with a third friend to see a movie or work on a project or something.</p><p>hanging out with that many people does keep my social network intact and growing. over time, i&rsquo;ve realized that even though my network developed well, i was exhausting myself in the process. not only did i have to coordinate and be strategic about when to meet who where (because trekking all over the city takes time and energy). i also had to explain what&rsquo;s happening in my life to 2-3 three people. as always, what i told to who was dependent on the person, the length of our friendship, and more. however, i started to notice that the 2nd and 3rd time i explained to someone how i was doing, i truncated the situation because i was just tired of explaining it again. of course censorship is necessary, but that type of censorship doesn&rsquo;t serve to build strong relationships. </p><p>so, i found that if i just commit to one social engagement per night i&rsquo;m not exhausted (physically, emotionally, or interpersonally), and i&rsquo;m more better able to show up for people i do meet up with.*</p><p>since i&rsquo;ve taken on this practice, people and friends of mine have started to realize that when i commit to hanging with them, it&rsquo;s for real. and an (unfortunately) irony that i&rsquo;ve noticed is that sometimes they can&rsquo;t show up as fully as i do because they have something else to run off to. </p><p>there&rsquo;s no judgment here, but i definitely prefer my situation. sure, i meet up with fewer people, but i definitely would rather have a small number of deep relationships than a large number of shallow ones. of course, it&rsquo;s not an either or with relationships, but still&hellip; the number of people i know who feel like they don&rsquo;t enough have close/deep relationships is astounding&hellip; (maybe i&rsquo;ll write about that soon).</p><p>* to me, showing up means paying attention, listening well, sharing meaningfully at meaningful/appropriate moments, and taking in action when necessary. in our <a href="http://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/">increasingly distracted world</a>, it’s surprising how few people know how to show up for each other. </p>
