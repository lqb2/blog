<p>back in the middle of may, i visited one of my favorite places in the world, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stitchdownfarm/">stitchdown farm</a>. my new friends, andrew and rita plotsky hosted a <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.instagram.com%2Fp%2FBEbTAVxQ44p%2F%3Ftaken-by%3Daplotsky&amp;t=NzUwYTI1MTkzNGM2YTk0ODc3Y2JkMzYyYzk3Y2MxYmQwMzE4NTM5YSx2Wm5kSGdrbg%3D%3D">lamb roast</a> and it was amazing. andrew and rita have a lot of social gravity and when they put their energy into it, they pull lots of super interesting people from all over the country to the space they create. i can always look forward to good conversations there.<br/></p><p>this time, andrew and i had a good conversations about how we’re both viewing our branding work. i described my work in a way that i hadn’t before and now i’m just writing it down.</p><p>to date, i think the story of my life has been systems thinking. all of my major life phases or decisions are marked by something systems related. first love at work (<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Floveatworkmissions%2F&amp;t=MWE1YWVmZDllYWEwYjBlYTYwYzdkNmEyMWNmY2E0MTg5MGZjZjg3MCx2Wm5kSGdrbg%3D%3D">a christian mission camp i used attend and work at</a>), then the food system, then cities. now branding.</p><ol><li>the decision to take time off from school was driven by my understanding of ‘love at work’s impact on the city of gretna, florida.</li><li>my return to college was prompted by my understanding of the potential of the food system to save humanity on the planet.</li><li>my focus on urban planning was driven by thinking of cities as systems.</li></ol><p>and now, i’m incredibly interested in branding. i think branding is the aesthetic manifestation of systems thinking. my other systems loves have not gone away. they’re now being rolled up into this new system.</p><p>we also talked about each of our brand holy grail’s. ours were sort of similar: branding a town/downtown. there is something exciting about shaping how current residents experience a town. it’s also exciting to think about how visitors and future residents will experience that same place. the most interesting question of all, though, is how to balance those two experiences.</p><p>anyway, branding as the aesthetic manifestation of systems thinking makes a lot of sense to me. i wonder if anyone else feels this way. hrm.</p>
