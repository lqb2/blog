<p>somewhere at the intersection of lean product development and systems thinking is one of my favorite ideas: never make the same mistake twice.<br/></p><p>the lean side of that table is continuous learning. the systems thinking side is how you ensure the mistake doesn&rsquo;t happen again. systems thinkers observe surrounding contexts and create structures that prevent known issues from arising again (see <a href="http://www.watersfoundation.org/webed/mod2/index.html">14 habits of systems thinkers</a>).</p><p>i genuinely believe one of the most significant parts of my personal system is this idea. as with most everything i do, it takes a small amount of energy each time it comes up, but over time, it creates massive gains. <br/></p><p>a recent (somewhat simple, but still real) example: this past weekend i was in nyc and i lost one of my micron pen&rsquo;s. i freaking love my micron pens and i try really hard to minimize my consumption of them by not losing them. last year, i made it through the year having used less than a single box (12 pens). so it&rsquo;s a big moment when i lose one. i thought to myself, how can i make sure this doesn&rsquo;t happen again? </p><p>the next day my friend, nate, had a little leather pen case out on the kitchen island we were standing at. i asked where he got it from, he said he made it and i could have it if i wanted because he could just make another one. i immediately thought, &ldquo;i don&rsquo;t actually need this little pen holder, but having it will help me not lose this pen again.&rdquo;</p><figure data-orig-width="2448" data-orig-height="3264" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://68.media.tumblr.com/47aa2e1aa79ebe5c28cf685d5a66df73/tumblr_inline_ocq01ubGTE1rdh2nt_540.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="2448" data-orig-height="3264"/></figure><p>in theory, not losing pens over time will save me money, frustration, and keep me from contributing to overproduction. </p><p>or something. </p>
