<p>not really sure where this post is going, so here&rsquo;s to just starting!<br/></p><p>one of my favorite inspirational quotes is by ira glass. it&rsquo;s been made into many videos, posters, etc., but my favorite is this one:</p><figure class="tmblr-embed tmblr-full" data-provider="vimeo" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-height="304" data-url="https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F24715531"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/24715531?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" width="540" height="304" frameborder="0" title="Ira Glass on Storytelling" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>it&rsquo;s what made me decide to develop my graphic design abilities more consistently. my big takeaway was that the only way to &ldquo;close the gap&rdquo; was to do more and more work. </p><p>but the other day i was listening to <a href="http://obsessedwithdesign.libsyn.com/weir-stewart">the wier/stewart episode of obsessed with design</a> and there was an interesting twist. </p><p>one of the interviewees said that, of course, anybody who has good taste and skills to bring that taste to life is amazing. i think he used the phrase &ldquo;mega designer.&rdquo; but that&rsquo;s not the only pathway out there to being a designer. it&rsquo;s also possible to have good taste and then be a curator of things in line with your taste. </p><p>this allows you to use your curation to solve maybe the same design problems that a mega designer could. some people sketch, refine details and perfect their own ideas; others curate and recreate and produce clever rearrangements of other ideas. there&rsquo;s space for both types of designer.*<br/></p><p>my old colleague, curtis, wrote earlier this year about <a href="http://interactioninstitute.org/network-leadership-roles-2-0/">the different roles of network leadership</a> and curation was one of them. as the world becomes increasingly connected and content-rich, the world will need more and more curators to help people sift and sort through it all. access to things humans have created in the past is increasing and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2010/08/04/schmidt-data/">we are creating more and more content every second</a>.</p><p>*  in fact, some people might even say that there isn&rsquo;t much of difference between those two types of designer because all creativity is is the recombination of disparate elements to solve a problem in a different context. </p>
