<p><a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_41">letter XLI to lucilius from seneca</a> has this passage that really resonated with me:<br/></p><blockquote><p>For what is more foolish than to praise in a man the qualities which come from without? And what is more insane than to marvel at characteristics which may at the next instant be passed on to someone else? A golden bit does not make a better horse. The lion with gilded mane, in process of being trained and forced by weariness to endure the decoration, is sent into the arena in quite a different way from the wild lion whose spirit is unbroken; the latter, indeed, bold in his attack, as nature wished him to be, impressive because of his wild appearance, – and it is his glory that none can look upon him without fear, – is favoured in preference to the other lion, that languid and gilded brute.</p><p>No man ought to glory except in that which is his own. We praise a vine if it makes the shoots teem with increase, if by its weight it bends to the ground the very poles which hold its fruit; would any man prefer to this vine one from which golden grapes and golden leaves hang down? In a vine the virtue peculiarly its own is fertility; in man also we should praise that which is his own. Suppose that he has&hellip; a beautiful house, that his farm is large and large his income; none of these things is in the man himself; they are all on the outside. Praise the quality in him which cannot be given or snatched away, that which is the peculiar property of the man.</p></blockquote><p>i think what i really like about seneca&rsquo;s letters to lucilius are the simple way that he expressed big truths. this insight, for example, isn&rsquo;t a new point. in fact, it aligns with most of my christian upbringing where possessions are perceived as a liability. Jesus himself tells people that some of them are actually hindered on getting into heaven because they have too much stuff:<br/></p><blockquote><p>Truly I tell you, it is difficult for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven.<b> </b>Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.” —Jesus<br/></p></blockquote><p>but what seneca&rsquo;s phrasing adds to it (which the bible says, just in other places and not that same passage) is that it&rsquo;s ones internal characteristics that should be celebrated and praised. if our society could get a real handle on that truth, we&rsquo;d be such a different reality. </p><p>on a similar note, my friend caroline, i were talking the other day and she came to a similar conclusion though from a different angle. she&rsquo;s had a really tough year. when we were chatting she said something like: &ldquo;at some point in life, everything external that we have will be stripped away or taken from us (if we don&rsquo;t die first, which is the ultimate stripping). and yet, who we really are still exists in those moments of having almost everything taken away.&rdquo; <br/></p><p>both of these insights have reminded me this week that what&rsquo;s internal is more important than what&rsquo;s external. as much as society repeatedly tells us that material possessions matter, they really just don&rsquo;t. </p><p>writing: 9:34<br/>spell-check, link-finding, &amp; formatting: 8:02</p>
