march is two things for me: women's history month and money matters month (aka money matters march). last moon cycle i made a light commitment to notice my thoughts, feelings, and reactions related to money. that was in preparation for this moon cycle (march 6 thru april 4) where _my intention is to be  curious as i dig into my relationships with wealth and financial health._

so. as a part of that, i am committing to writing and sharing one sentence every day that i've noticed as a result of my curious exploration of wealth and financial health. 

* 6: felt intense relief when i found out my healthcare covered an outstanding $517 bill (which was on its third notice and about to be sent to a collection agency) i had from 2018.
* 7: regret for not knowing i had a co-pay card that i could have used back in nov and saved me $380.
* 8: the idea of saving enough money to live for six months feels literally impossible. 
* 9: maureen helped me see that one of my first reactions when i get paid is to spend (burn) some cash, often gifts for others or myself.
* 10: the value of wealth is in its gifting, not its hoarding or stagnation.
* 11: i have a huge amount of resistance to taking time to review my personal and business budgets monthly. 
* 12: spending money on food with friends is a unique spending experience. it **never** feels burdensome.
* 13: committing to 20min/week on my financial systems feels like a breakthrough (thanks, maureen!)
* 14: my loan holder sold my debt to another company and i can't figure out how to log in to the new website to check my balance. i am disproportionately angry.
* 15: 
* 16: i would rather pay $100 for two float sessions (1 for me and 1 for a friend) than $75 for a float just for me.
* 17: even if i have the $ available, it feels good to schedule big payments in advance if i can.
* 18: getting paid makes me feel so excited.
* 19: business expensing purchases feels easy... maybe too easy? 
* 20: paying bills, especially healthcare bills, feels so heavy. 
* 21: i sometimes forget that i can use my credit card. i think that's a good thing. 
* 22: it feels great to spend money on good food and/or businesses i want to support.
* 23:
* 24: saving feels so easy when my checking accounts look full.
