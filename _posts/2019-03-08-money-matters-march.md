march is two things for me: women's history month and money matters month (aka money matters march). last moon cycle i made a light commitment to notice my thoughts, feelings, and reactions related to money. that was in preparation for this moon cycle (march 6 thru april 4) where _my intention is to be  curious as i dig into my relationships with wealth and financial health._

so. as a part of that, i am committing to writing and sharing one sentence every day that i've noticed as a result of my curious exploration of wealth and financial health. 

6: felt intense relief when i found out my healthcare covered an outstanding $517 bill (which was on its third notice and about to be sent to a collection agency) i had from 2018.
7: regret for not knowing i had a co-pay card that i could have used back in nov and saved me $380.
8: the idea of saving enough money to live for six months feels literally impossible.
