i am continually surprised by people's excitement about AI. 

call me a luddite, but i'm not into it. the main reason? having read [amusing ourselves to death](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/74034.Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death){:target="_blank"} by neil postman and having other media awareness and critique, i don't trust that we are collectively well-educated enough to not eventually be fooled at a catastrophic level by something fabricated by machines that most of us don't understand. 

that said, i didn't come here (today) to write about that. today i'm here to write about an insight i had in a conversation the other day that freaked me out: AI is primarily using english. 

it's long been known that a bias of the internet is that it's mostly in english. i think as of 2024, the data is that ~60% of the internet is in english. last i checked, about 20% of humans speak english. and when i think about the historical knowledge of the world, the majority of it is *not* in english *and* the majority of it is not on the internet. 

so AI, which uses the internet as data source, is doubling down on several biases/limitations. what freaks me out about that is that some people are already beginning to assume (without criticality) that the answer AI gives them to a question is the best answer. 

that. freaks. me. out. 

what to do about it? i don't know. but i def want the record to show: i'm not a fan (at least not yet).

ps - i know that many folks use AI with appropriate criticality. but i worry that, given the state of education (in america at least), many folks don't.
