today was the day; we were going to meet her. 

she was the same age as us. well... sort of... 

aya was born 5 days before we met. she, like the others like her, had come into existence around when we had. at her birth, our relationship energy had fused with her soul and they became one soul. in a sense, she *was* our relationship. althoughshe was separate from us, her identity was linked ours. 

we arrived at her house, knees knocking so loudly we were sure they could be heard over the gentle door knocking we did. 

her parents ushered us in, "come in, come in! dinner is waiting and some of us are ready to dig in."

we at down to the table and laid our eyes for the first time on her. she was shockingly cute! all babies are cutie, she was absurdly so. 

although she was a little shy in some ways, her inner knowingness was clear and fierce, like us. since she could use baby sign language, she had let her parents and other adults around her know exactly what she did and did not want, just like we did. and, like us, it seemed her whole being was birthed inside of and around the dinner table...
