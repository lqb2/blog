ha! so i totally did keep track of what i did on day 3 and day 4 of my annual reflection retreat this year (which is different than what i started out thinking [yesterday]({{ site.baseurl }}2018/01/30/annual-reflection-review-part-3/)). as i've learned [in previous years]({{ site.baseurl }}tags/#reflection-ref), spending 1/2 the time looking back and the other half looking forward felt like the right way to do it. so days 3 and 4 were all about planning and thinking about 2018. i'm not quite sure what to write here other than a straight up list of everything i did, but i'll just get started and see what comes out...

oh, and i should say that the things that happened on day 3 and 4 didn't just come up randomly nor did i have a fully thought out plan going in to these days. back in november (when i started thinking about when to have and what to do in my [annual reflection retreat][medium]), i started a list (on the apple notes app) of things i thought might be useful to do during my retreat. i just threw any idea in there that i had myself or that i heard. and then, i prioritized that long list on dec 31 so that i could just start rolling through it once my retreat started. 

## day 3

* finish revising & update of [vision statement][vision]
* finish friend ecosystem
* calendar stuff
* begin draft of shadow calendar (what would an ideal month look like?)
* plan time for daily, weekly, and monthly chores/routines
* start contacting woes to schedule bi-weekly or monthly hangs
* make a conference attendance strategy (what filter am i using to help me decide whether or not i want to go a certain conference? also, set a cap of 6 gatherings/convenings for the year. otherwise i spend too much money and don't have enough space/time to meaningfully follow through with the new connections/relationships). 
* find a week to edit my book (29th birthday week!)
* begin drafting [my phrase/mantra for 2018]({{ site.baseurl }}2018/01/07/be-a-conduit-and-other-2018-phrases/)
* complete list of commitments to myself this year and start putting on my website
*  write up self-care strategies() (inspired by [rusia's post](http://universalpartnership.org/strategies-for-self-care/)) (_note to self: update this link when i launch lqb2.co_)


## day 4

out of time... more tomorrow...
