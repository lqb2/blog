so i've been taking the last few months to slowly ruminate on the elements of the revolutionary uncle manifesto. 

i've spoken with both james vamboi and abraham lateiner for feedback and thought partnership. for now, i'm connecting with cis-males because that's where i'm coming from and i want to be grounded there (in all that social locations' complexities) before moving towards collaboration and partnership with other folks along the gender spectrum. 

i need a first draft of the manifesto for the final project of [my coach training](https://www.healingjusticeliberation.org/cohort){:target="_blank"} and even though it feels too early for a real first draft, here's what i'm going with:

what must revolutionary uncles be or do: 

* grieve
* listen
* be present
* share wisdom
* develop themselves
* seek right relationship
* inspire kids and be inspired by kids; shape kids and be shaped by kids

i am excited to put those points down as a first stake in the ground. i trust that this will evolve, especially as this project moves from an individual ideation to a collectively held vision. i can already see myself in a year (or less) looking back at this list and thinking "HA! can you believe i/we thought *that*?!"

anyways, those 7 points are a distillation of thoughts i've had or ones that came from james and abraham. here are ALL the points that have come up so far: 

revolutionary uncles must: 

* cook
* be present (for themselves, their nibblings, their siblings, their parents, extended family, their friends, and their community)
* practice reciprocity
* seek right relationship
* share wisdom intentionally with generations that come after them
* listen
* grieve
* are in right relationship with time 
* grow (but on the inside)
* be willing to practice even with it doesn't appear to make sense
* know their awesomeness
* know that the kids are awesome
* be open to being shaped and inspired by kids
* know their role is sacred
