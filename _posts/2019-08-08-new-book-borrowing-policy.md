earlier this week, i was with kalia, marty, and their child, iona, and a funny moment happened that i think is worth sharing. 

i was asking marty if could borrow a book of his. kalia gifted it to him but he hadn't read it yet and he threw out "you can borrow it as long as you give me a summary when you're done." and then, seamlessly without missing a beat, kalia jumped in and said "well wouldn't that a good policy for whenever someone borrowed a book."

i vigorously agreed! i was really down to agree because:

1. i already have a practice of summarizing books when i finish them. see my archive of that [here]({{ site.baseurl }}tags/#book%20reviews-ref). 
1. me and leo are building [an archive of my book highlights](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1dZapzJz371t98KralZfaNwmavL7rjrQA). for now the folder is over here in basic google docs format but we have dreams for bigger... imagine a website that shows all the notes and then links ideas across books. ^_^

anyway, i think this is a practice i can definitely commit to and now really want to! 

oh, i also started an ["on-loan" shelf on goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/61877628?shelf=on-loan). it contains books i'm borrowing as well as books that other people are borrowing from me. i used to have a little personal library system on index cards back in elementary and middle school which is how i kept track of my books but i left it fall off (because i was like 12 lol). anywho, bringing it back now! if you have a book of mine, lmk. :)
