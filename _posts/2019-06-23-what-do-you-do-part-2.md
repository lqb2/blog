if you know me well, you know that i hate the question "what do you do?" the reasons for that hate are myriad and i wrote some of those thoughts up a [few years ago]({{ site.baseurl }}2016/07/19/on-the-question-what-do-you-do/). some reasons i'd add to that are: 

* what people usually mean when they ask it is "what do you do for paid work?" if more people just asked that and not ask the shorthand version, i think i'd hate the question less. it's the embedded assumptions that get to me
* some askers of this actually care about way more interesting things, but  aren't sure what else to say to get a conversation going because we generally don't learn about how to have good conversation in school
* in some contexts/from some askers, it's a question of [class signaling](https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/social-class-first-seven-words) and/or human-worth signaling. the question beneath the question is really "how much are you worth? is it more or less than me? how do i relate to you based on how much our society values you?"

my friend [maureen](https://www.maureenwhitecoaching.com), likes to play with the question by filling in something fun that's more along the lines of a question she actually wants to talk about. 

"what do i do for fun? well, i read a lot..." 

backing up to that second bullet, i think there are lots of people who actually want to know things way deeper than the question of what do you do for paid work. here's what i imagine is actually happening:

people really want to get to more core info about this new person they're talking to, but don't know how. 

in this moment, i think it's actually critical we learn to break out of this question. i think our ability to have small talk while we are facing a mix of global challenges never faced before is literally killing people. i also think, from an organizer's perspective, often what we are wanting in conversation is to know to what someone actually cares about. 

given all of that, i've thought a lot about pathways out of that awful, awful question over the past few years. some thoughts:

1. sometimes when people ask me what i do, i directly ask back why they asked me that question. i generally get one of two responses: a) "oh i was just starting small talk." from there, i usually launch into a conversation about small talk (which is 9/10 times more interesting). b) they respond with a deeper question. then i answer the deeper question. 
1. most times i'll just offer a different question and answer that: 
    1. what's important to you?
    1. why do you do what you do?
    1. what are you dreaming about?
1. sometimes i do what maureen does and fill in a different thing that i think is more interesting. "what do i do for [unpaid work, healing, self and community care] is..."

anyway, i used to say "go deep or go home" back when i was in my tallahassee christian community. i still think that's true, but now it's like an existential planetary intention.
