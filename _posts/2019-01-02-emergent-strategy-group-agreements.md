these agreements come from [adrienne maree brown's](http://adriennemareebrown.net/) [emergent strategy](https://www.akpress.org/emergentstrategy.html), published in 2017. 

* Listen from the inside out, or listen from the bottom up (a feeling in your gut matters!); 
* Engage Tension, Don’t Indulge Drama;
* W.A.I.T.—Why Am I Talking?
* Make Space, Take Space—a post-ableist adaptation of step up, step back - to help balance the verbose and the reticent
* Confidentiality—take the lessons, leave the details;
* Be open to learning;
* Be open to someone else speaking your truth;
* Building, not selling—when you speak, converse, don’t pitch;
* Yes/and, both/and;
* Value the process as much as, if not more than, you value the outcomes;
* Assume best intent; attend to impact;
* Self care and community care—pay attention to your bladder, pay attention to your neighbors
