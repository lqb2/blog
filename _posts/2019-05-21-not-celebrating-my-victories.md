as i continue to work on this month's lunar cycle intention of "being patient with myself as i get in right relationship with time," i've had a conversation with two or three friends about an insight i think i'm developing. 

i have a pattern that is similar to a few other friends: we do a LOT but when we think about what we still have to do, there is a feeling (or fear?) of not doing enough. it's a paradox, really. 

and i've started to think in the last week or so: maybe part of my overwork is related to the fact that i don't celebrate or tally my victories well enough. maybe "i'm not doing enough" could become "wow! look at how much/well i'm doing. i can totally take more breaks!"

i regularly support organizations to celebrate their victories as a part of culture change. it's a part of [white supremacy](http://www.dismantlingracism.org/uploads/4/3/5/7/43579015/whitesupcul13.pdf) to not celebrate and appreciate each other. it keeps people, even when they're doing well, in need of that basic human desire: to be validated by one's community. not doing it, makes people deeply unhappy. doing it can have huge impacts on how people feel and then act in a context. 

so i started to think: if this is so impactful at the organizational scale and i believe in the fractal nature of reality, why wouldn't this also be impactful at the individual scale? 

now the question is: how will i incorporate this into my life? i feel like i already have solid structures so i'm not sure where to fit this... but it seems important enough to be foundational so i need/want to fit it somewhere... hmmmmmmmm! maybe i'll just sit with it for a bit. need to go get ready for the day anyways. 

ciao!

ps - i also know that a big part of my overwork is related to industrial capitalism and our racialized economy, which incentivize/require me to work extra hard to maintain/experience stability.
