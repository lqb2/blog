earlier this year (feb), my alternative futures accomplice (grant williams) and i wrote a renga ([instructions on renga writing here](https://www.poets.org/poetsorg/text/renga-poetic-form)) as a step towards producing our futurist manifesto. the 'festo is still on the way, but here's the poem.

is time linear?
maybe it is circular
either way, weâ€™re now

Ancestors in training, speak
Wildest dreams fit for grandkids

back and forward, reach 
for whose dreams are we fit from?
we aren't only ours 

All runs through us, one river
Be like water, shape oceans 

flowing constantly 
space, a tool for our best work 
time, an illusion

Space:Time asks to be molded
We Bend the arc towards our dreams 

when moonlight reveals 
those deepest wishes unknown 
tremble at their strength 

infinity's long power 
brought to bear within our wishes 

What weight can be freed
As wings lift, the veil falls free,
No myth unshaken

yet if freedom is commitment 
where might (un)caged birds fly but home 

Your mothers arms knew 
What futures your ribs contained
Encrypted marrow 

every birth holds life anew 
ashes to flesh, dust to bone 

New worlds incarnate
Fingertips spark galaxies 
Best days yet to come 

begin with the mind 
manifest with the body 
confirm with the heart
