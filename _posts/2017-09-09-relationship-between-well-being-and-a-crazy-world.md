earlier today i was working on my book and editing the essay on love. one sentiment that has been floating around the past couple of days is about the relationship between self-care and care for others. even today i was texting my friend dan in orlando about his prep for the hurricane and i was saying to him that i always struggle with where to draw the boundaries between taking care of myself and taking care of others, especially when things are crazy. 

and then just now, after my writing session ended, my incredibly thoughtful downstairs neighbor, pella, came out to chat because she saw me picking tomatoes from my garden plot. as i was telling her what's going on with me, i said "i'm just trying to figure out the relationship between me being well and the world being crazy." and it really resonated with her. we talked about wanting to be well on an individual level while still engaging meaningfully with the craziness of the world and being part of it changing.

and then, during lunch i was, i was reading [radical dharma: talking race, love, and liberation](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29429650-radical-dharma?from_search=true) and jasmine syedullah dropped this line in her chapter called radicalizing dharma dreams:

> _"We are experimenting with new strategies for survival."_

i don't know if i can say that my thinking about relationship between self-care/personal well being and engagement with the craziness of the world around is a part of the experimentation, but it does sort of feel like it (you know, living in a world where VUCA is the norm, not the exception)...

so yea, new leading edge question: what is the relationship between me being well and the world being crazy?
