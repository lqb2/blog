**What are the main ideas?** 

* everyone has a story that, for the right audience, will be transformative when heard. sometimes that audience is an audience of one. the transformation of one person is still important (my personal addition: because you never know what that one person will do as a result of being transformed.)


**If I implemented one idea from this book right now, which one would it be?**

* find a story buddy! someone who i can call before and after i share my story in a vulnerable way.

**How would I describe the book to a friend?**

this is the best little guidebook i think i've read all year. it's got excellent framing and a few chapters in the middle that punch way above their apparent size. don't let the beauty of the book catch you off guard: this one is a heavy-hitter. the density of tips, ideas, and practices is like that of a neutron star.
