in [the on being episode with matthieu ricard][ricard], krista quotes this section from his 1998 book, _[the monk and the philosopher](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/192411.The_Monk_and_the_Philosopher)_: 

> My scientific career was the result of a passion for discovery. Whatever I was able to do afterward was in no way a rejection of scientific research, but arose rather from the realization that such research was unable to solve the fundamental questions of life — and wasn’t even meant to do so. 

in the show, krista and matthieu go on and discuss in detail from where that sentiment came, from both narrative and spiritual/value approaches. but even just that quote really makes me think. 

for reasons that i'm sure i could figure out but don't currently know, there seems to be a perception in the west in that religion and spirituality are anti-discovery. i know there are probably some roots to that sentiment in the enlightenment. but i'm thinking most recently about how in semi-socialist and previously/currently communist countries, religion is held with disdain. it's "the opiate of the masses" or just seen as backwards and dumb. 

and sure, maybe that **is** generally true of religion. but, in my mind, there's a difference between religions and spirituality. the spiritual realm deals with internal, non-physical phenomena. 

under that category, there is **so** must to discover. fundamental questions of existence to me belong to the spiritual realm. 

in fact, some of the scientists & researchers i respect the most have **deep** spiritual lives. and that allows them to not feel limited or trapped or hindered by the things their research can or can't prove. 

anyway, i just really appreciate this thinking and it makes me really mourn for folks who are missing out because of a misperception (is that the right word?) about what spirituality is and therefore misperceive what science can and can't do.
