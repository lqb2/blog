hi! today, 16 april 2021, is my 32nd birthday. if you'd like to send me some happy birthday energy, here are a few options: 

- [reflect on what covid/pandemia has taught you by writing in this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FKqBpq-pwmvBROnVyY_Cc4K_iEIo9g_AqKk2cdxMiWU/edit?usp=sharing)
- send me money on venmo (@Lawrence-BarrinerII) or cashapp ($lqb2)
- find a local organizing group that is working to abolish the police, make a donation, and then share about the organization on twitter or IG and tag me (or fb but i'm not over there). note: i'm not asking you to tell me or post how much you donated. you're welcome to but i just want to signal boost folks/orgs doing this work in the midst of national media failures to actually cover police in ways that change the situation. 
- hug someone (safely) for at least three breaths. thich nhat hanh has great instructions on how to do this and why. see [hugging meditation](https://www.lionsroar.com/how-to-practice-hugging-meditation/){:target="_blank"}

thanks, friends/lovers/collaborators/colleagues.
