a few weeks ago i was in a work meeting christine hutchinson (hutch!) and she mentioned something that i said i'd write about because i thought it was brilliant and hilarious. 

hutch is a schoolteacher and she told me about something she calls "reactive teaching." 

reactive teaching is when she gives her students the assignment before giving them a lecture or lesson. why? because they often start off not wanting to listen to her. but when she starts out this way, they work on it and end up realizing they can't do the work and **then** they're ready to pay attention to her teaching. 

hi. lar. ree. ous. 

now, i have no idea how how this tracks with formal teaching pedagogy or whatever but it feels like one of those brilliant interventions created by practice, not by theory. but i would be 0% surprised if this tactic came through some deep philosophical researched reasoning from hutch as well as her practice. 

anyway, that's all i wanted to share in this post. every once in a while i write a post that really is just to capture someone else's idea who i ask/know isn't going to put it out there themselves. so here we are. cut. print. send. 

thanks, hutch, for allowing me to write this up!
