back in 2018, i wrote that i hadn't yet learned much [about personal systems/habits/routines in moments of change]({{ site.baseurl }}2018/12/30/personal-systems-in-change/ ){:target="_blank"}.

welp, it's been 5 years now and i have now, in fact, charted some of that territory. 

in summary, what i was talking about in the earlier post was the question: what happens when you've built a habit that no longer works for your goals or doesn't work in specific contexts? 

here's what i've learned:

* habits can expire. sometimes, i build a habit for a particular circumstance and then that circumstance changes. it's totally fine at that point to let that habit go. i may decide to replace it with another or simply just let it go. (ex: a few years ago, i wanted to learn more about how the days shortened and lengthened over the course of the seasons. so i built a habit of drawing sunrise and sunset on a chart every month. after a year, i had learned the lesson. so i put the habit down. )
* well-built habits are relatively easy to pick back up. (when i don't write for a while but want to put together a new essay or longer piece, it's pretty easy to jump back into my 10 mins/day morning writing habit). 
* a habit working in some contexts but not in others may say more about that context than the habit itself. (when i travel, the fact that my 2-3 hour morning routine doesn't fit is less about the routine and more about what it's like when i travel: i'm usually in a special situation and part of that circumstance is prioritizing friends, family, or work)

anyway, and as always, there's more to share here but i'll put the pen/fingers down for now. thanks, nisha, for inspiring me to write this up!
