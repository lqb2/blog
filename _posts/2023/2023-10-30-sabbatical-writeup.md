_important preface!: i thought i was going to write this whole post at once and then realized i needed to write it in chunks in order to not be overwhelmed by it. and then i realized it made the most sense to write it in separate pieces with separate titles rather than filling in the outline chunk by chunk. so what you're about to read is the first chunk with a little pre-amble and the outline. and then from here, i'll write the other separate pieces. it's disjointed but i'm a big fan of 'done is better than perfect.' here we go!_

i did it! i did my first [sabbatical]({{site.baseurl}}2023/08/13/sabbatical/)!

overall: super amazing. worth every single ounce of work it took to make it happen. i feel forever changed and wish everyone could take sabbatical-style breaks! (i am so jealous of the august-off tradition that exists in many parts of europe). 

as i've started to tell folks about my sabbatical, i'm getting clearer about what i want to share via writing about it. i'm also thinking i might do a recorded zoom or audio type call for folks who want to hear about it via voice and be in discussion about it. but for now, here's some extended thoughts in writing:
