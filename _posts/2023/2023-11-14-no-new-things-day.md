happy belated equinox (23 sept). aka happy (fifth) no new things day!  

i was on sabbatical this year for no new things day and that sort of forced my hand on "no new things" day this year: because i had to put everything down to go away, i realized that i needed to stop doing new things before sabbatical even started (12 sept). 

truth be told, i have a lot i want to say about "no new things day" this year and i feel so overwhelmed by all the things on my plate that i don't have time to in this moment. 

so this post is just a quickie to acknowledge that i've been doing this for five years (omg wtf is time?!). 

no new things day is a practice in stopping doing new things so that i can actually have a slower winter. it's hard af to actually slow down and so so good when i can actually do it. so here's to no new things! üçæü•Ç
