ok this is my last post reflecting on [anil dash's interview on on being](http://www.onbeing.org/program/anil-dash-tech-s-moral-reckoning). 

at the bottom of this post is the section of the transcript that my thinking is based on. 

there are two points that anil makes in this section of the show that stuck with me. first, technologists, without ethical training ([which is most of them]({{ site.baseurl }}/2017/01/20/tech-industry-woes-part-1/)), can and will do things that seem interesting regardless of the consequences. the example he gives is about a "live updating" polling meter on the new york times' home page on election night 2016. the page presented little needles that swayed back and forth, giving out the message that it was a live update of votes as they came in. when anil looked at the code, he (and anyone else with programming knowledge) could see that the dataset updated at most a few times per minute. so this little addition of animation essentially made the visualization false. 

and what was the impact of that? anil believes that the amount of stress that created for site visitors was pretty serious and also unnecessary. this, to anil's suggestion and my explicit claim, is unethical.

consequently, the second point that stuck with me was that our education systems needs to train us to be able to look under the hood of things that shape our lives. tech for youngsters seems like a requirement these days. i think it would also be good for the general population to get training (popular education style?) about how web development and apps work given that they're taking over our lives and society. 

as i'm writing this i guess a last point is that we should always remember that all things are based in some real physical system. tech companies (driven by capitalism) like to create "magic" by invisibilizing the clunky parts of systems. by bringing things to your door, delivery services mask the massive physical and people infrastructure needed to support it. by putting your chicken breasts in bags in the freezer aisle, grocery stores mask the fact that a real live chicken lived somewhere (probably in terrible conditions) and was killed in the process of creating those breasts. wendell berry has a lot to say about how and why this is problematic for the scaling of our society and community in his book of essays [*sex, economy, freedom, and community*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/146150.Sex_Economy_Freedom_and_Community?from_search=true). definitely a good read.

yikes. i'm over time! gotta go!

## relevant quote from the [transcript](http://www.onbeing.org/program/anil-dash-tech-s-moral-reckoning/)

MR. DASH: ...I bet a lot of you saw on election night, on The New York Times homepage, their animated, live, real-time data. They had these needles waving back and forth on the meter, which I think is probably the single most stressful implementation of technology I’ve ever seen in my life.

[laughter]

MR. DASH: And what it was — and I always think of this — actually, with systems thinking in general, in any institution, I always try to imagine the meeting — back track a few months, a few weeks to the whiteboard meeting, and a bunch of people with empty coffee cups sitting around sketching out what this thing is going to be. And somebody says — and it’s probably a young guy, and he’s probably a computer science grad — and he says, “You know, we can get the data in real time. We can get polling data, and we can put it on the homepage. And it’ll be incredibly compelling.”

And if you look at the page that made up that New York Times homepage while they were doing that chart on election night — and there were these wild swings of the needle for a long while. For hours, it was literally swinging back and forth between Clinton and Trump in “real time,” what they called “real time.”

MS. TIPPETT: [laughs] Right.

MR. DASH: And if you look at the code of the page, that was all fake. The data only updated, at most, a few times a minute. The needle never stopped moving. But I could see that. And what percentage of people that went to that page that night could see that? Maybe one percent, maximum. And it was so — one, it was causing undue stress to a lot of people. Two, it was, as danah said, making spectacle of data explicitly. And the animation was not true. It was not real.

And so what does it mean that there was a choice to put something false on their homepage when they are trying to decry all the falsity? And would they have allowed falsity from any other public-facing part of their organization except the technologists?



this is my penultimate thought from the on being anil dash interview.

anil is a big advocate for retiring the term "tech industry." at one point during [the interview](http://www.onbeing.org/program/anil-dash-tech-s-moral-reckoning/), he made a pretty compelling argument about how "technology" is really just new stuff, but only for a short time. 

for example, when industrialized agriculture was new, those farmers were likely considered technologists. extrapolating from there, i can think back to when fire as a tool in trains was considered "high tech." as was using water as a driver of machinery. hell, at some point even wind power itself was considered high tech, before it went out of style due to fire, fossil fuel, and water (though now wind is back in high tech).

on another related note, calling something a part of the technology industry only makes sense when referring to things created after you were born. if you grew up with something, you just consider it a part of life. 

this thought had a big impact on anil and it's having a similar effect on me. his thought (in full langauge below) about the ethics of figuring out what impact the temporarily new thing you're working on is going to have on the world before it just is considered part of how things work is a great framing. if i think about the world i want my kids to inhabit, what do i want to build that they will grow up with? how does that change what i spend my time and energy on? i wonder if silicon valley would act differently if they thought this way?

but i digress... my interest in anil's point here is that he believes ["the tech industry" is no longer a useful term](https://medium.com/humane-tech/there-is-no-technology-industry-44774dfb3ed7#.dqvqb9auw). is definitely was useful, but that usefulness ended when silicon valley stopped being about silicon. 

what we need to do is call these companies what they are (livery services - uber and lyft, food prep services - blue apron, farm companies - freight farms) so that they can be regulated in ways that make sense. tech companies, for various racist, sexist, and patriarchal reasons, are able to avoid all sorts of things that other companies can't. so let's put them back in their boxes before they consume the entire world in search of profits and kill us all. 




> MR. DASH: I describe myself as being in the technology industry, but technology always means “things invented after you were born,” basically. And so there was a time when the technology industry was the wheel. And there was the time when the technology industry was fire. And its every iteration along the way has been — the first people to do agriculture were the technologists of their time.

> So I’m just saying that context of “this is only temporarily new” has been really, really helpful for me. And I think — and I guess it’s especially true, again, since becoming a parent, but just in general — like, marveling at the briefness of the time we have. And I think, how lucky to be at this genesis moment for something actually new. How rare to be at a time when things changed, even with all of the negatives that come, and all of the hard problems that come.

> MS. TIPPETT: And all of the risk that always is there when change comes.

> MR. DASH: Yeah. And of course, I know how fortunate I am to be on the right side of those changes. I think — my parents are from one of the poorest and most remote parts of India. My dad’s village today — a family of four around that area lives on between 600 and 800 dollars a year. And I think the quality of life improvement from my father growing up as a British subject with no vaccines and no clean running water to my son living in Manhattan is perhaps the greatest single generation leap in quality of life in the history of humanity.

> And so that weighs on me a lot. To be bookended by these two incredible people, like, my parents on one end and my son on the other, it feels like a grave responsibility. To get to be the conduit between the greatness of what my parents have done and the greatness of what my son will do, I think is the thing I think about every day. So it’s — well, I have these tools, and they’re novel now, and they will be boring very soon. And so, en route to them being boring, how can I be sure that they are just?
