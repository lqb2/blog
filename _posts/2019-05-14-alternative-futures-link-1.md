August 24th, 7:24am

It’s the morning of August 24th; I turn 17 tomorrow and I’ll finally be able to Link while conscious. I feel like I've been waiting for this moment for my whole life...

"Look, you can't tell me he's not ready. I've been watching him grow his whole life. I literally carried him in my body and then watched him by carried by our Home. I know he's ready," Shai said.

"I hear you, friend. I really do. But he and I have a different relationship than yours. Every time you come to pick him up, I tell you something we talked about that surprises you. Why do you think that is?"

Shai sat back on the couch and crossed her arms. 

"Hmmm?" I nudged. 

She took a deep breath. "Ok, fine. I'm listening now. What's your big worry?" 

I leaned forward, wringing my hands a bit. 

"We both know his dad. And we know his dad's inability to hold even his own boundaries. In some ways, that's how Jayden is here."

Shai winced. 

"I'm sorry, but I had to say it. I need this to feel real. Real and grounded. I love you both, but I worry that his linking could lead to addiction pretty quickly. Do you remember that one time, he was 6?"

"Yea, I remember. I was so shocked," she responded.

"I was, too. I couldn't believe he lied to both of us, in front of us! He knew he only had one hour of TV time and he played us against each other. Now... can you imagine...? He's three times older and is about to get access to as much pleasure as his body can handle. Can you imagine what he's going to be able to do?"
