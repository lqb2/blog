## Interior Condition and Transmission

"...from tool mastery to cultivating the interior condition that shapes the space.""

- What am I bringing into the room simply by being?
- How does my energy impact what becomes possible?

Let curiosity and presence continue to guide your facilitation—not just what you do, but who you are becoming.

## Curiosity Disrupts Assumption

"...catching assumptions before they land can shift everything. Keep playing with the somatics of “Hmm.” Let surprise be a co-facilitator."

## Let’s not Turn “Interior Work” into Something Else to Achieve

The work of cultivating presence is not to avoid getting in trouble or to be good. It’s a sacred orientation toward truth and trust. Let’s let it be rooted in inherent goodness, not performance.


## Continue Experimenting with Feelings-Based Conversations

- Keep noticing how people react when you pause to check in before answering “How are you?”
- Observe not just their responses but your own internal experience. What arises emotionally in these moments?
- Perhaps most important: Pay attention to the emotional labor involved. How does this practice affect your energy, and where might you need to tend to yourself more intentionally?

## Strengthen Your Disappointment Resilience
- Reflect on your relationship with disappointment. Especially the distinction between being disappointed by others versus in yourself.
- Consider journaling about:
	- Moments when you felt disappointment and how you navigated them.
	- How do you tend to process disappointment? Notice any patterns?
	- What practices or perspectives might help build resilience around this experience of disappointment?

## Exploring Transmission & Holding Space for Emotional Energy

- In facilitation, experiment with holding emotions as they show up, letting them move through, rather than moving to “fix” or resolve them.
- Notice how your own awareness changes the emotional landscape in a room.
- Observe how energy moves in facilitation—where does it shift naturally when simply acknowledged?

## Observation Practice: Teaching & Transmission in Facilitation

After each facilitation, journal on:

- What did I teach? (even if not explicitly)
- What was I transmitting beyond the content?

This isn’t about changing anything yet—just noticing.


## Engage with the Season’s Energy

This is Pisces season, your favorite! 😉 Like you said, it is a time
for fluidity, intuition, and emotional openness.
Consider simple ways to attune to it, such as:

 - Taking a moment each day to acknowledge that you’re in this
 - season.
 - Looking up at the sky and asking, “What does this season
 - have for me?”
 - Letting the energy of the season subtly inform your
 - interactions and facilitation.

This isn’t about a grand practice—just small moments of
recognition and inquiry.
