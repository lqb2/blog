_this is a piece from the latest [unleashing alternative futures](http://unleashingalternativefutures.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"} writer's circle call on 21 dec 2021. the activity was two parts. in part 1, everyone brainstormed and discussed in pairs three wins they had over 2021. in part 2, everyone took 15 minutes to write a story using three of the wins from the full list. the twist was that each writer could select any three wins, not necessarily just their own victories. grant and i (who created the activity and hosted this call) hoped that this would create an opening for people to find connectivity and each other's successes, to practice what it is like to integrate the reality that when one of us wins, we all win._

even though it’s hard on them, i must say, i am enjoying these times the humans are in. 

it’s like, all of a sudden, a HUGE number of them woke up and started paying attention. i hate that all of our quiet nudges and pokes didn’t get through to enough of them quickly enough. i hate that it took such massive calamity (to their world, not ours) to jolt a critical mass of them into consciousness. but hey, you can lead horse to water but they’ll only drink when they’re ready, right? 

and the folks that woke up recently, phew! the ripples they’re creating… wow. they’re really taking our lessons to heart: everything is connected! 

they’ve finally stopped all that wicked extraction because they finally saw the cost it was having on their own bodies; they finally saw that they couldn’t extra from the earth without extracting goodness from themselves. 

they finally saw the immense joy that is possible when they spend days, weeks, at a time just hanging out with each other. 

they finally saw they that me and the earth are in this with them, not against them (and just in the nick of time, too…)

— a fun guy
