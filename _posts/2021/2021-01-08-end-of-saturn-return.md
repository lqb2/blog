## ~~Aquarius~~ & Aquarius Rising

As Saturn travels through your 12th house for the next 3 years, it will ask you to release many ideas of yourself that ultimately don’t serve your long-term growth. Saturn will ask you to grapple with the fears that aren’t based in the present, but are very much rooted in the past. It will help you battle the self-destructive patterns that operate unconsciously.

It’s time to understand the intangible obstacles to your growth.

This takes a specific kind of effort on your part. The kind that asks you to have patience with your own process. The kind that asks you to lean more heavily on your ability to hold, with consciousness, the irrational emotions that erupt rather than trying to make sense of them. Some of this work will be obvious from the onset, while some of it makes sense only after learning to trust your healing process.

Through this process, Saturn will help you come to terms with what in your life is coming to a natural close. What is finishing up all on its own. What is working itself out without needing you to push, shove or force anything from yourself. The more you relax into this process the more wisdom you will be able to align yourself with and the more you’ll be able to tune into what is being conceived deep within you.

All life begins in the dark.

While much is growing and flourishing in your professional life, a new seed of potential gets fertilized in a part of your life that is hidden from everyone. Perhaps even you for a time. What this potential will grow into is not yet known. What it needs only you will come to understand. What it offers you however is the possibility to work on something in secret, without the glare of the public or the scrutiny of the critics. Protect this seedling. It will tell you when it is time to break through the surface of your life but for now it needs the deep nourishment of being underground.

## **~~Aries~~** & Aries Rising

As Saturn enters your 10th house of career, reputation, and public life, you are initiated into a 3 year process of professionalism. Boss-ness. Whatever you are able to define for yourself in your career during this time will impact your professional pursuits for decades to come.

Part of this process will involve you following the clues, signs, and signals that Saturn will be laying out for you. Clarity will come, but only a little at a time. Piece by piece. Brick by brick.

The only thing you need to do is answer the professional call that is loud and clear.

To bring yourself into being through this process, you will labor like you’ve never known. But if you make love the motivation, the monuments you build will become a healing shelter. A space for transformation to occur. A cauldron that can transmute fear into fierce love.

Make your work into a practice of self-realization. Make it a place where you practice what you preach. Make it a place where you practice pouring yourself into structures of integrity.

Nothing cures heart-break quite like applying yourself to what you believe in.

Let Saturn teach you that part of the process of mastery is feeling like a fool. Fucking up. Finding a way through the shame and fear that arise when we cross a threshold into a new level of our abilities. Let Saturn’s harshness help you not take personally what isn’t. Saturn teaches us how to create sturdy boundaries. Knowing what isn’t about us saves such incredible amounts of time. Days. Months. Years. Eons. Massive amounts of energy we can redirect towards the things that need our attention, love, and care. Knowing how to channel our efforts, energy, and fierce heart is half the battle of becoming a grown, professional person that can help the planet progress.

Never underestimate that part of Saturn’s teaching to you.
