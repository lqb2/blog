[The Art of War by Sun Tzu](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1223690.The_Art_of_War){:target="_blank"}



<b>What are the main ideas?</b> 

* the best way to win a war is to not fight (i.e. be so effective at outsmarting or outmaneuvering your opponent such that fighting is never necessary).
* if you have to fight, do it quickly. the longer you are in battle, the more likely it is you will lose by attrition.
* use the terrain to your advantage. if the terrain is not to your advantage, wait to advance until it is.
* if it is unlikely you will win a battle, retreat and build strength or wait until the circumstances are in your favor. 


<b>If I implemented one idea from this book right now, which one would it be?</b>

"even people who dislike each other, if they are in the same boat, will help each other." in situations of conflict, how can i help people understand they are in the same boat?


<b>How would I describe the book to a friend?</b>

this incredibly brief edition of the art of war boils down vast theory into bite-sized chunks. it's dense and insufficient, but this distillation seems to preserve the main principles. if you want an understanding of the roots of strategy, which is historicially military, this is a goodie.
