<b>What are the main ideas?</b> 

* our energy bodies are very real, as real as our physical bodies.
* most of us don't learn how to work with energy, our own or that of other people. this lack creates a colossal amount of maladaptive behavior. 
* there are multiple (at least 6) types of intuition. 
* intuition is an extension of our normal senses (taste, sight, touch, etc.)
* learning to manage our energetic boundaries (what we let in vs. what we keep out) can help us stay more grounded and well. 
* when one person in a (nuclear) family is energetically imbalanced, it can throw off the whole family unit.
* people are more often than we expect open to information and conversation about empathy, intuition, energy and the like. sometimes all it takes to get the conversation going is a willingness to be the first to take a vulnerable step and say something.


<b>If I implemented one idea from this book right now, which one would it be?</b>

* i can choose (and change) at any time how much energy of others i am allowing to permeate my energetic boundaries. 



<b>How would I describe the book to a friend?</b>

if i'm honest, i was only about 60% ready for this book. a TON of what's here was deeply useful insight about energy (like... the electromagnetic waves that parts of our bodies generate that can be measured outside the body), intuition, empathy, and how to manage it all. the author weaves her personal experiences and history with questions, quizzes, and brief surveys to help you get clear about your own gifts. there are some things in here that truly feel beyond my current level of willingness to accept/hear/understand. but given how parts of what she's said really do land, i can only imagine that she's really onto something with the more far out (to me) insights...
