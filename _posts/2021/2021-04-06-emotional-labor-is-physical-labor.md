emotions are feelings. i'm not totally sure how the word "feelings" has become connoted to mean "thoughts" but emotions are actual sensations we feel in our bodies. i feel anger in my skin, i feel sadness behind my eyes, i feel grief in my upper and mid-back. the work/labor that is associated with being present to our feelings is physical labor. 

this insight came through in the post-patriarchy futures: patriarchy in the family group (s/o milan, reed, michael, and chris!). i was talking about avoiding a conversation with my dad and realized that the resistance was *in* my body, aka my emotions. i was avoiding the convo because of my feare that i wouldn't be able to hold the emotions that came up in the conversation. 

this insight feels powerful for many reasons but one big one in particular. i think the conversation on emotional labor has mostly been framed around emotions as internal. the dialogue is unintentionally and implicitly positioned as conceptual, ideological, and/or individual.

but that's all wrong. emotional labor is learning how to be with our **bodies** which are physical things. 

i feel like this is already opening up all sorts of metaphors that might be helpful in my/our work to dismantle patriarchy. what if crying was seen as a muscle that you could do reps to strengthen? ok so maybe that wasn't a great one but i am just beginning to feel out the possibilities here...
