super quick post here!

last month i was facilitating the opening and closing of the management center's all staff retreat and i/we stumbled on some ableism in the activity named "dialogue walks." i've also heard them named "walk and talks"; still ableist. 

i named that ableism in the room and folks started offering alternative names: 

- convene and glean (chloe davis-carden) (may 2023)
- pivot and pair (sarah hodgdon)
- shvitz and shmooze (deb sherman)
- wonder wander (trish adobea tchume) (2 nov 2023)

in that moment, i think was really feeling the alliteration of pivot and pair so that's what i went with for the momentary rebrand. and i'm curious! what other names for this activity do you have that doesn't assume that all people can walk? leave a comment!
