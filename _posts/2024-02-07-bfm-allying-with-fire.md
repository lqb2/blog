<p class="message">it's feb! that means it's black history/futures month. my goal in 2024 is one flash fiction story per week. all stories from this month and past years <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}tags/#black%20history/futures%20month-ref">here</a>.</p>

_preface:  today's story is inspired by the episode of [how to survive the end of the world with adaku utah](https://endoftheworldshow.org/episodes/witch-school-chapter-19-adaku-utah){:target="_blank"}._

more than the other elements, this day required pain. 

after tending to the hearth fire 100 days in a row, it was time to bring the fire into myself. well... more like onto. but after the full initiation of all 4 elements is complete, into and onto stop making sense...

i held the chunk of spellbound metal in my hand. a long rod, a thick handle at one end, across from the hye won hye (the adinkra symbol meaning "that which does not burn") on the other. i turned it over and over, stalling. was i really about to do this?

i gulped uncontrollably. 

i knew the benefit. once marked by the fire, i would be able to make my internal fire external without harm. every time i tried now, i got burned. that's normal for someone still in their allyship training, but it still sucked. i was ready for that part to be done. 

but i didn't feel ready to go through my first scarification. and yet, i knew, in order to have fire as a true ally, it must be done...
