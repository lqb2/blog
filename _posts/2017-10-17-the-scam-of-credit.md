so maybe i'm thinking about this all wrong, but last month i had a real visceral experience with the scam of credit. i've known/felt ever since i was little that the concept of credit didn't really make sense (back when i learned about the sin of [usury](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usury) (like the original definition of usury) in like sunday school), but back in sept i had a real experience of the twistedness of the system. and i say that not having done *anything* wrong. here are the pieces that i saw. 

the last time i checked my credit score it was at 780. i have a lot of privileges that make that possible. 

i got a jetblue credit a little over a year ago because it had a 0% apr, gave me excellent bonuses, and had no annual fee.

_thanks to don wei for making me sign up when the points were still at this multipler. they have since gone done to 3x maximum._

i used that card regularly and paid down the balance every month. i just wanted the points and to build my credit.

then, i learned (from within the barclay credit card app) that your credit score goes up more if you're using about 1/3 of it every month. in fact, your score can actually go down if you're not using enough credit. 

the card started out with a $10k limit. i felt comfortable getting it up to 3k and paying off the previous month balance before it accrued interest. so i did that for a while. points still rolling in, still no interest payments. 

at some point after the 1year mark several things happened. first, jetblue/barclay sent this really exciting notice that my credit was so good that they bumped up my credit limit... to $16k. i was pumped because WOW; that's a lot of money to have access to, right? 

then card's annual fee kicked in: $99/year. i thought, well, paying 100$/year to have such a good credit score and access to that much credit isn't *that* much money. 

then, my apr kicked in: %21. at that point i was pissed.

so now, to keep my score up i need to be rolling with 1/3 of $16,000 (which is ~$5,500) and i have to pay down the entire previousm month balance in order to not pay interest. well, i definitely can't make payments like that so i'm paying interest now. like $60/month. and on top of the annual fee, that's like $800/year. at this point, none of this seems worth it anymore. i'm not tryna pay almost $1000/year to have good credit. that seems absurd to me and like a full-on scam.

of course, it's possible that maybe i'm missing something from the bigger picture. but a question that someone asked on an episode of death, sex, and money about student debt() has really stuck with me: "does anyone else think it's crazy that it has just been normalized that we're just supposed to go through our entire adult lives saddled with debt? whether it's college or a home mortgage or business debt or credit cards, it just seems like to do anything adults do you're just supposed to have debt. that seems fucking weird." 

and i agree.
